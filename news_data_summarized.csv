iPhone 16E Name is Increasingly Likely Instead of iPhone SE 4 - MacRumors,"Apple is expected to announce a new entry-level iPhone model tomorrow, and it is increasingly likely that the device will be named iPhone 16E.   Most...",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-16e-name-is-likely/,technology,"Apple is expected to announce a new entry-level iPhone model tomorrow, and it is increasingly likely that the device will be named iPhone 16E.



Most rumors have referred to the device as a new iPhone SE, since it will succeed the iPhone SE (3rd generation), but there is mounting evidence that the device will be named iPhone 16E instead of iPhone SE (4th generation).

As a refresher, the iPhone 16E name was first mentioned in December by Fixed Focus Digital, an account with more than two million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Later that month, a leaker known as Majin Bu on X also cited a source who claimed that the next iPhone SE will actually be named iPhone 16E.

In a follow-up post today, Majin Bu cited a source who has apparently seen an iPhone box with the name iPhone 16E on it. In addition, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes that Apple CEO Tim Cook's teaser post about a ""new member of the family"" being announced this Wednesday suggests that the device will indeed have a new name. And last, there are several Amazon listings for so-called iPhone 16E cases, although that could be guesswork.



The device is rumored to feature a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, a USB-C port, Apple Intelligence support, an Apple-designed 5G modem, and more. Apple should reveal pricing and a release date tomorrow.",Apple is expected to announce a new entry-level iPhone model tomorrow.

Google app on iOS removing Gemini as it pushes users to full app - 9to5Google,The Google app for iOS is removing Gemini support as the company pushes iPhone users to the full Gemini app.,http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-app-removes-gemini/,technology,"Google is informing iOS users that it will be removing Gemini support from the main Google app as it pushes users over to the full Gemini app.

One of the first ways to access Gemini on iOS was through the main Google app, which offered a switcher between Google Search and Gemini for several months. However, as Google has built out the Gemini experience, new features have been missing from the Google app – a key example being Gemini Live. That’s because Google has been focused on the full Gemini app for iOS, which launched in November.

Now, Google is letting iPhone and iPad users know that Gemini is “no longer available” in the Google app.

In an email sent to users, Google says that “Gemini is no longer available in the Google app,” emphasizing that “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini.” The email reads in part:

We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS. Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. With the Gemini app, you’ll have access to all of the same features and more.

Google removed the switcher interface earlier this month, as we previously reported, but the experience is currently still live in the app via the “More” tab with Google app v356.0 on iOS. However, we previously noticed that a pop-up that directs users to instead download the full Gemini app for iOS via the App Store.

Some users may no longer be able to use Gemini in the Google app for iOS

OnePlus Watch 3 is missing an important feature in the US and Canada - GSMArena.com news - GSMArena.com,The company has come clean about the limitation. Earlier today OnePlus made the Watch 3 official without much fanfare. It builds upon the seeming success...,https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_watch_3_is_missing_an_important_feature_in_the_us_and_canada-news-66603.php,technology,"Earlier today OnePlus made the Watch 3 official without much fanfare. It builds upon the seeming success of the OnePlus Watch 2 and OnePlus Watch 2R with an even bigger battery that should last for up to five days for normal use and even up to three days with intensive use.

There's also support for ECG readings, but there's a catch regarding this function. Namely, it's not going to be available in the US and Canada because OnePlus didn't receive official certification from the FDA for the Watch 3's ECG capabilities.

Thus, the ECG Analyzer feature won't be available in those countries. You'll still get a version of the new 60-Second Health Check-In feature in the US and Canada, one that will not include ECG readings, starting at some point in the second quarter of this year (so between April and June).

This comes straight from OnePlus, which has issued a statement on the matter to 9to5Google. It's obviously unfortunate that the ECG feature won't be working everywhere, but at least the company has come forward revealing the limitations on the first day of pre-orders, so you can make an informed buying decision on the new wearable.

Speaking of which, the OnePlus Watch 3 is now up for pre-order for $329 / €349 / £319. Shipping will start on February 25 in some countries, and in early March in others. Do also note that your local OnePlus site might have an extra discount from the RRP if you pre-order.","The Watch 3 has support for ECG readings, but there's a catch regarding this function.

Batman: Arkham games among those losing PhysX powers on newer Nvidia GPUs - Ars Technica,The 32-bit tech on older games can’t bring snazzy effects forward.,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/batman-arkham-games-among-those-losing-physx-powers-on-newer-nvidia-gpus/,technology,"Most PC games that you can play on a modern PC would run faster on an Nvidia RTX 5080 or 5090 than, say, a GTX 1070. But some games, from a particular phase of enthusiasm for particles, destructible environments, and smooth-moving hair, will take a notable hit if their owners upgrade to the latest Nvidia cards.

That's because PhysX, once a dedicated physics simulation tool and card that became a selling point for Nvidia's gear, has been largely deprecated on Nvidia 50-series cards. The transition was announced in January, but it seems to have taken some time for someone to notice the impact on 32-bit, PhysX-enabled games (as seen by PCGamesN). The most recent of these affected games, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, came out in 2013.

What follows is a brief primer on PhysX: what it was, what it did, and why it's left out of Nvidia's road map.

From Citadel Station to Geralt’s hair

Many years ago, if you wanted impressive physics in your game, someone had to build it in code. Seamus Blackley, who would one day create and design the Xbox, took his graduate-level physics knowledge and applied it to System Shock, making it the rare game where the player's body had real mass to it and grenades bounced off walls like you might think they would.

These days, game engines like Unity can handle a lot of the physics thinking for developers. But in the years between, there was PhysX. PhysX started as a simulation engine from a Swedish firm, NovodeX, then was acquired by Ageia in 2004 and expanded to include hardware cards.

PhysX cards held such promise that, at one point, Tim Sweeney—back then, known primarily for Unreal Tournament—considered adding support for a PhysX card for the 2007 version of his game.

But Nvidia bought Ageia in 2008 and got to work incorporating PhysX into its own GPUs. The newly green-hued PhysX showed up as an SDK available to all PlayStation 3 developers, and Nvidia made outreach efforts to get developers thinking about PhysX support from the beginning. It worked, to some extent, with games like Mafia II and Batman: Arkham City showing off advanced particle, collision, and other physics effects. You could shoot a wall and leave holes in it, and smoke didn't look so much like a flat sprite trick, but a real thing that took up space.","PhysX, once a dedicated physics simulation tool and card that became a selling point for Nvidia's gear, has been largely deprecated on Nvidia 50-series cards.

Humane is shutting down the AI Pin and selling its remnants to HP - The Verge,"HP has acquired Humane, its AI platform Cosmos, and its employees for $116 million following the rocky rollout of its AI Pin.",https://www.theverge.com/news/614883/humane-ai-hp-acquisition-pin-shutdown,technology,"is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

Humane is selling most of its company to HP for $116 million and will stop selling AI Pin, the company announced today.

AI Pins that have already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET on February 28th, Humane says in a support document. After that date, Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries / responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time.

After the shutdown, offline features like “battery level” will still work, Humane says, but “any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access” will not.

Humane will only offer refunds on AI Pins that are “within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date,” according to an FAQ about the shutdown. Refunds “must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.” If you have paid for a Humane subscription past February 28th, Humane says “..we will process a prorated refund.”

Anyone who had been waiting for a replacement charging case following its recall will “automatically receive a refund for the portion of your original purchase price that was allocated to the Charge Case after February 28, 2025.”

HP is buying Humane’s CosmOS, bringing on Humane technical staff, and will get more than 300 patents and patent applications, Humane says in its press release.

Humane reportedly started looking for a buyer shortly after the launch of the AI Pin at a price as high as $1 billion — a lot more than the $116 million acquisition price announced today. And the AI Pin appears to have sold quite poorly, with The Verge reporting in August that daily returns were outpacing sales. Humane cut the price of the Pin in October.

And while Humane did end up adding some new features to the AI Pin’s CosmOS software, the company also appeared to be attempting a pivot to positioning CosmOS as an operating system other companies could put into their gadgets and devices.

Bloomberg reports that “Humane’s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate artificial intelligence into the company’s personal computers, printers and connected conference rooms,” per an HP executive. The new team will be called HP IQ, which will be “HP’s new AI innovation lab focused on building an intelligent ecosystem across HP’s products and services for the future of work,” according to an HP press release.","Humane is selling most of its company to HP for $116 million and will stop selling AI Pin.

Huawei’s record-breaking Mate XT tri-fold is officially available worldwide - 9to5Google,The tri-fold market is officially off to a hot start as Huawei has announced the now globally available Mate XT....,http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/huawei-mate-xt-launch-global/,technology,"The tri-fold market is officially off to a hot start as Huawei has announced the now globally available Mate XT. Huawei is happy to brag about a few broken records, considering the phone is the first tri-fold commercially available.

Up until now, users have been trying to adjust to a new type of device in the foldable phone, which only has two viewable screen formats. The tri-fold is a whole new corner, allowing users to use the device in not only the open and closed phase but also a third, larger tablet-like phase.

Huawei’s Mate XT is the first commercially available tri-fold device. It first launched in China but the Mate XT is now available on a global scale, except in the US. Other companies like Samsung have publicly toying with tri-fold concepts, but Huawei is ready to get it out into the world as is.

The Mate XT has two hinges, with one side bearing a vulnerable foldable glass edge. When closed, it comes in at 6.4 inches. The first unfold uncovers a 7.9-inch screen, while the second unfold will open the phone up to 10.2 inches, which is the size of a modern tablet — not exactly a small one.

Huawei likes to boast that the Mate XT is the largest tri-fold device available. This is true, but only because it’s the only tri-fold device available. When another crops up, it might not be bigger than the Mate XT simply because this early in the design phase for many companies, there isn’t one right way to do it. We saw this with foldables like the first Pixel Fold and Oppo Find N2. Huawei also notes that the now global Mate XT is the world’s thinnest foldable when unfolded. At 3.6mm, it even beats the Oppo Find N5’s 4.47mm. Of course, when folded up, the Mate XT comes out to 10.8mm thick.

The Mate XT is going to be an eye-catcher out in the wild, and it’s now accessible globally outside of China.","Huawei’s Mate XT is the first commercially available tri-fold device.

Microsoft warns that the powerful XCSSET macOS malware is back with new tricks - Ars Technica,XCSSET has been targeting Mac users since 2020.,https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/microsoft-warns-that-the-powerful-xcsset-macos-malware-is-back-with-new-tricks/,technology,"Microsoft said it has detected a new variant of XCSSET, a powerful macOS malware family that has targeted developers and users since at least 2020.

The variant, which Microsoft reported Monday, marked the first publicly known update to the malware since 2022. The malware first came to light in 2020, when security firm Trend Micro said it had targeted app developers after spreading through a publicly available project the attacker wrote for Xcode, a developer tool Apple makes freely available. The malware gained immediate attention because it exploited what, at the time, were two zero-day vulnerabilities, a testament to the resourcefulness of the entity behind the attacks.

In 2021, XCSSET surfaced again, first when it was used to backdoor developers’ devices and a few months later when researchers found it exploiting what at the time was a new zero-day.

New enhanced features

Microsoft said it has detected the new variant in limited attacks so far. Improvements in it include:","Microsoft says it has detected a new variant of XCSSET, a powerful macOS malware family. The malware first came to light in 2020, when security firm Trend Micro said it targeted developers."

Xbox CEO Confirms What We Knew: The Console Wars Are Over - Kotaku,Phil Spencer is no longer trying to get PlayStation or Nintendo fans to switch consoles,https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304,technology,"In case you didn’t notice, the console wars—the decades-long battle between mulitple companies and their plastic game boxes—ended a few years ago. And while Sony continues to fight on with its PlayStation despite the war being over, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer recently confirmed that, yeah, it’s all over, and the company is no longer trying to steal users away with exclusives.

English The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023

Over the weekend, Spencer sat down for a lengthy interview with XboxEra in which he discussed his favorite games, talked about what various Xbox studios are working on, and dished on the industry at large. And he was also honest about Xbox no longer being part of any console war, as it shifts to selling Xbox games on other consoles, like PlayStation.

“I would love to make all of the money for all of the games that we ship, right? Like, obviously we make more on our own platform,” said Spencer. “It’s one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important. But there are people, whether it’s their libraries on a PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it’s they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there.”

“I’m not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore,” added Spencer.

That last quote, about not trying to bring everyone over to Xbox anymore, is a very telling one. And for sure, Xbox hasn’t really been competing with Sony or Nintendo for a few years now—that kinda stops when you start selling your games on their platforms—but this is confirmation from Spencer that Xbox was once fighting in the console wars and that it no longer is part of that battle, as the entire point of the console wars was to sell more boxes and steal away other players with exclusives.

XboxEra

Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer further explained that Asia is one of Xbox’s “fastest-growing regions,” and it’s thanks in large part to Cloud Gaming via Game Pass and PC. And according to Spencer, the users driving this are players who were never going to buy an Xbox.

“We were never going to catch that person with our console,” said Spencer.

So let’s find them in a way that works, and it’s better for Indiana Jones. It’s better for Xbox.”

If it wasn’t obvious before, this is the ultimate confirmation that the console wars have indeed ended.

Nintendo doesn’t care anymore and just releases consoles whenever it works best for itself rather than trying to directly compete with the other big players in the space via powerful hardware. Xbox is happy to sell you a game on PS5 or Switch or even just let you stream it via the cloud. No console needed, though it still plans on making and selling some in the future. The only one still fighting in the war is Sony. So I guess they won, but I’m not sure it really matters in 2025.

iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Aluminum Frame Instead of Titanium Frame - MacRumors,"Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has...",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-pro-models-aluminum-frame-rumor/,technology,"Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.



In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, obtained by MacRumors this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.

This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.

Aluminum frames were already rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models once before.

Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations. Aluminum generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, and Apple is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality for all of its products and supply chain by 2030. Following in the footsteps of the Apple Watch, and the latest Mac mini, perhaps some iPhone 17 models will be advertised as Apple's first carbon-neutral iPhones.

It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's thin and light design. We may have a partial explanation, though. Last year, fellow Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would use a mix of titanium and aluminum, with a lower amount of titanium compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. Apple surely has its reasons here, so hopefully we will find out more details before the iPhone 17 series is unveiled in September.","The iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Max are all expected to have aluminum frames. Apple has previously used a stainless steel frame for its highest-end models."

Battlegrounds Updates

Dev Comment: This mid-season update is a big one! It brings StarCraft to Battlegrounds with new heroes and the rewards track cosmetics unlocks; it brings back and updates Anomalies; and it brings a much requested feature: combat speed-up! There’s so much to cover that we can’t even fit it all in the patch notes. So, jump into the Tavern and see it for yourself—all these changes are live now!

Anomalies Return!

Anomalies are back in Battlegrounds and, for the first time, in Duos! Anomalies are tavern-transforming effects that apply to all players from the start of each game. Adapt to the chaotic influence of the Old Gods to claim your crown!

Chinese hackers abuse Microsoft APP-v tool to evade antivirus - BleepingComputer,"The Chinese APT hacking group ""Mustang Panda"" has been spotted abusing the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector utility as a LOLBIN to inject malicious payloads into legitimate processes to evade detection by antivirus software.",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-abuse-microsoft-app-v-tool-to-evade-antivirus/,technology,"Update 2/18/25: Added ESET's statement to the end of the article.

The Chinese APT hacking group ""Mustang Panda"" has been spotted abusing the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector utility as a LOLBIN to inject malicious payloads into legitimate processes to evade detection by antivirus software.

This technique was discovered by threat researchers at Trend Micro, who track the threat group as Earth Preta, reporting that they have verified over 200 victims since 2022.

Mustang Panda's targeting scope, based on Trend Micro's visibility, includes government entities in the Asia-Pacific region, while the primary attack method is spear-phishing emails that appear to come from government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, or law enforcement.

The threat group was previously seen in attacks targeting governments worldwide using Google Drive for malware distribution, custom evasive backdoors, and a worm-based attack chain.

The emails spotted by Trend Micro contain a malicious attachment containing the dropper file (IRSetup.exe), a Setup Factory installer.

If executed by the victim, it will drop multiple files into C:\ProgramData\session, including legitimate files, the malware components, and a decoy PDF to serve as a diversion.

Files dropped on the infected device

Source: Trend Micro

Evading antivirus

When ESET antivirus products are detected (ekrn.exe or egui.exe) on a compromised machine, Mustang Panda employs a unique evasion mechanism exploiting tools pre-installed on Windows 10 and later.

The abuse starts with the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector (MAVInject.exe), a legitimate Windows system tool that allows the operating system to inject code into running processes.

It's mainly used by Microsoft's Application Virtualization (App-V) to run virtualized applications, but developers and admins can also use it to execute DLLs inside another process for testing or automation.

In 2022, cybersecurity firm FourCore reported that MAVInject.exe could be abused as a LOLBIN, warning that the executable should be blocked on devices not utilizing APP-v.

Mustang Panda abuses the executable to inject malicious payloads into 'waitfor.exe,' a legitimate Windows utility that comes pre-installed in Windows operating systems.

The legitimate function of waitfor.exe on Windows is to synchronize processes across multiple machines by waiting for a signal or command before executing a specific action.

It is primarily used in batch scripting and automation for delaying tasks or ensuring that specific processes finish before others start.

Being a trusted system process, the malware that is injected in it passes as a normal Windows process, so ESET, and potentially other antivirus tools, does not flag the malware's execution.

The malware injected into waitfor.exe is a modified version of the TONESHELL backdoor, which comes hidden inside a DLL file (EACore.dll).

Once running, the malware connects to its command and control server at militarytc[.]com:443, and sends system info and victim ID.

Mustang Panda attack overview

Source: Trend Micro

The malware also provides attackers with a reverse shell for remote command execution and file operations, such as move and delete.

Trend Micro believes with medium confidence that this new variant is a custom Mustang Panda tool based on its functional characteristics and previously documented packet decryption mechanisms.

Update 2/18/25: ESET disagrees with Trend Micro's findings, sharing the following statement with BleepingComputer:

“ESET communications teams were made aware of a research blog published by Trend Micro that names ESET “antivirus application” as the target of APT Group Mustang Panda a.k.a. Earth Preta,"" ESET told BleepingComputer.

""We disagree with the published findings that this attack ""effectively bypasses ESET antivirus"". This is not a bypass and we are bemused that Trend Micro did not alert ESET to discuss their findings.""

""The reported technique is not novel and ESET technology has been protecting against it for many years. Regarding this specific sample of malware, ESET had previously published details about it through its premium Cyber Threat Intelligence service and added specific detection since January. We have attributed the threat to the China-aligned CeranaKeeper APT Group. ESET users are protected against this malware and technique.”","Chinese APT group ""Mustang Panda"" has been spotted abusing the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector utility as a LOLBIN to evade detection by antivirus software.

Windows 11 update breaks File Explorer - among other glitches - ZDNet,Microsoft's latest Patch Tuesday fixed several bugs but triggered several problems. Some users are struggling just to install the security update.,https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-update-breaks-file-explorer-among-other-glitches/,technology,"Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET

Microsoft keeps running into brick walls with the 2024 version of Windows 11. Each new update designed to fix the outstanding bugs ends up introducing other problems. That's apparently true with the February Patch Tuesday update, prompting users to complain of File Explorer issues, installation glitches, and more.

Launched as an automatic update on February 11, KB5051987 added a few helpful features and resolved a host of bugs, both old and new. Among the glitches resolved were ones that affected digital audio converters, USB audio drivers, USB cameras, and passkeys. The update also patched several security vulnerabilities, including some that were deemed critical.

Also: Don't ignore Microsoft's February Patch Tuesday - it's a big one for all Windows 11 users

OK, that's the good news. Now for the bad.

After applying KB5051987, many Windows users have been hit by troubles with File Explorer, as spotted by Windows Latest. In some cases, File Explorer fails to respond when you try to open folders such as Desktop, Documents, and Pictures. In other cases, File Explorer refuses to open if you try to access it through the desktop shortcut or Windows Search. In still other cases, clicking on a folder's arrow in the left sidebar to view its subfolders produces no response.

The explorer.exe program still appears in Task Manager, indicating that File Explorer is running and hasn't frozen or crashed. One thought was that File Explorer conflicts with third-party tools. However, according to Windows Latest, the problems pop up even on plain vanilla systems with no third-party customizations.

Beyond the glitches with File Explorer, some people have reported issues simply trying to install the update. Sometimes, the installation stops at 96%, kicking off an error that something didn't go as planned. Other times, you're told that KB5051987 can't be installed because some update files are missing or have problems. Some users with MSI-based systems say that the update gets stuck at 0% for several hours.

To try to resolve installation issues, Windows Latest suggests clearing the SoftwareDistribution folder where Windows stores its update files. You'll find that folder under C:\Windows. Otherwise, you can just wait several hours or overnight to see if the installation finishes on its own.

Also: How to create a Windows recovery drive in 4 easy steps - before it's too late

Other glitches that may pop up include a stuttering mouse, an undetectable camera, .NET apps that cannot be installed inside the Windows Sandbox, and the Taskbar's new preview animation that does not work properly. You may also encounter other roadblocks. One person in the Windows Feedback Hub said that after installing the update, the battery life shows only 2.5 hours versus 6 hours previously. Another person found that the clipboard history no longer copies items from Microsoft Word.

On my end, I applied the February patch and haven't yet noticed any of the reported glitches. However, I've found that the Windows desktop now takes much longer to appear after I log in. I've also noticed a couple of odd issues that randomly occur and then vanish if I reboot. For example, right-clicking on a folder or file in File Explorer sometimes fails to trigger the context menu. I reboot and try again, and then it works fine.

Also: Microsoft has a big Windows 10 problem, and it's running out of time to solve it

Each annual Windows update can suffer from bugs, especially after being rolled out to millions of users. However, Windows 11 24H2 has been more problematic than usual. Since its official launch last October, the 2024 version has carried with it a host of known issues, many of which still haven't been resolved. As we get closer to the October 2025 deadline for the Windows 10 support cutoff, Microsoft needs to ensure that Windows 11 is a more stable and reliable system.",Microsoft's February Patch Tuesday update fixes bugs and adds new features. But some users have been hit by problems with File Explorer. KB5051987 also patched several security vulnerabilities.
Fellowship Hands-on and Q&A – A Game All About MMO-like Dungeons - Wccftech,We've checked out the upcoming 'multiplayer online dungeon adventure' game Fellowship and talked with the developers ahead of public playtest,https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/,technology,"Stockholm-based independent developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced that Fellowship, an upcoming 'multiplayer online adventure game' (MODA), will be playable in a Public Playtest available during next week's Steam Next Fest from February 24 to March 3.

For the Public Playtest, there will be servers available in North America, Europe, and Asia. In this preview build, players will have the chance to experience six heroes (two Tanks, two DPS – including a new DPS, Tariq, and two Healers) that will be in Fellowship's roster, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot.

Ahead of the Public Playtest, Wccftech was invited for a private play session with the developers. The best analogy really is dungeons from massively multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs), played after selecting a roster of predefined heroes, each in a specific role of the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank/DPS/Healer). Fellowship strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like. The replayability is also enhanced by Curses, which are gameplay modifiers on the dungeons that are mechanical extra layers that you have to deal with, and these keep rotating for each difficulty and each dungeon you do.

As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time on MMORPGs, the core concept definitely has a lot of merit. However, I found the execution lacking, mainly because it sticks way too closely to what MMORPGs have been doing for over twenty years. I'm referring particularly to the tab-target combat system, which felt very static and somehow even worse than World of Warcraft's in this regard. The dungeon mechanics I've seen, while introductory, are interesting; but it won't be enough if the combat itself is too stale. In short, yes, I would have attempted action combat, or at least a hybrid system like those featured in games like Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online.

The graphics are also not at all impressive for a game that's made with Unreal Engine 5. It obviously follows the Blizzard mandate to deliver stylized graphics and ensure maximum compatibility, but one thing's for sure, you won't be playing Fellowship because of its visuals.

Anyway, here's my conversation with Chief Rebel during the play session. The studio was established in 2018 by developers who previously worked on games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, Tom Clancy's The Division, Just Cause, and more.

What's the core premise behind your game?

In many MMOs, this high-complexity PVE content is gated behind hundreds of hours of leveling up. We want to make sure that Fellowship is approachable for newer players and something quick to jump in for veterans.

I see there's a kill score count. Can you explain what it does?

The kill score kind of totals the amount of enemies that we should kill in a dungeon run, so we can't just find some clever route to skip to the bosses. If you hit M on your keyboard, by mousing over enemies on the map, you can kind of see what percentage of the kill score they fill. As a tank who's kind of leading the direction we're going, I can pick out which routes I want lead the party through. But you have to fill the kill score to 100% and kill all the bosses to complete the dungeon, but there's a lot more enemies than 100% in the dungeon.

The intention is, especially when you get to the higher tier and the leaderboard chasing, part of the strategy is finding a good route through the dungeon, what paths should the party skip, what are more dangerous or maybe worth taking, even though they're dangerous using pull downs and all that.

When the timer gets turned on, then you also have to beat the dungeon within the timer to get to the next difficulty, but you're still gonna get all the loot that you would get from the dungeon, regardless of whether you beat the timer. We don't activate the timer until difficulty 4, though.

I assume the timer is going to be a key factor in climbing the leaderboard.

Yes, absolutely. The timer affects the score as well, so when players start to get to the really high difficulties, it's gonna be a matter of practically milliseconds to determine who's number one on the leaderboard.

By the way, as you can see on the left, we have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing.

You can see each of us there above the action bar. You see our health bars (I'm the purple dude), and you can see on the damage meter how we're doing on that damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.

This is also really important if you're going to get into optimizing your gameplay and being competitive and learning how to complete dungeons at really high difficulty, but it's not as important when starting out because, of course, we tune the game to be very forgiving in the beginning.

One of the barriers for a lot of players in some of these types of games is stuff like the DPS meter isn't built into these MMOs. It's something that you have to go online and search for and you gotta download add-ons and all that. As a player trying to find your role in the community, it can be a bit difficult to find your footing.

So, we don't really have any intentions of allowing player-made addons in Fellowship. Instead, we want to make sure that we're providing everything that veteran players want and expect in the game itself to ensure a level playing field for everybody.

Aren't you worried about online toxicity? Some MMORPGs have tried to move away from DPS meters mainly because of that issue.

I think that toxicity is always something that there's work to do with. I think that the solution is not to remove the ability for players to understand how to get better. I mean, there's different types of games. In some, your performance doesn't really matter, but in a game where your performance matters, you need to have information to be able to know what to change to improve, or you'll just start to hit your head against the wall.

If there's any kind of competitiveness, just removing data, I don't think that's the solution. I think that needs to be worked with in other ways. We're trying to find lots of other ways of getting ahead of that as well.

'We have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing. You can see our health bars and how we're doing on the damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.'

How do you plan on dealing with the 'meta' situation in your game?

In a lot of the MMOs or games where you're playing with a group, inevitably, a meta is going to be established. One of the reasons why you may choose one character or one class over another is because they have a utility ability that's really important to have at high levels of difficulty. In Fellowship, we've moved a lot of those big utility skills like mass dispel to equippable items that you unlock in higher difficulties so that anyone can bring a battle resurrection or a dispel or stuff like that to a party.

One thing you might notice as well is that we're trying to look into how we can handle some nonverbal communications. If you target one of these buccaneers and you hit V on the keyboard, you'll put your hero portrait next to their name. If you put your marker up and interrupt the enemy, you can see when we interrupt ours, meaning you'll know the cooldown on our interrupt skills so we can more easily manage the cooldowns of the whole group. This is another example where, at low difficulties, interrupting is not that important, but when you start to get to very high difficulties, not interrupting might get you one-shotted. So, it's really important for players to be able to coordinate and work together to ensure they have all the interrupts ready.

How many skills is each hero going to offer?

We're going to have 15 abilities available for each of the heroes. You unlock more and more abilities as you reach higher difficulties. What you're starting out with is just the interrupt, the movement skill, and some basic core kit, but then a lot of the abilities that come are CCs, utilities, cooldowns, and things like that.

Can you talk about the various dungeons and boss fights?

Sure. As the difficulty rises, bosses and enemies in the dungeon learn new abilities. What we're seeing here is this boss's base kit and then, as you get higher, she'll get some new tricks that make the boss a little bit more interesting for when you're ready for the increased challenge.

In Fellowship's dungeons, we have 3 bosses to kill. They take around 20 to 30 minutes to complete, depending on gear, difficulty, skill level, et cetera. And then we also have Adventures in the game. These are single-boss dungeons that take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. You can compete in both formats for the leaderboard score. To get higher on the leaderboards, you need to improve the average score of all your dungeons. But if you're someone for whom half an hour is a bit too much of an investment to put in, you can just jump in and do the 10-minute ones and still get the full conversion and all that.

Does Fellowship include some sort of crafting?

Yeah, we have a bunch of different progression systems. Firstly, there are talents that are hero-specific, where you'll unlock ways to customize your hero. There's also the gear itself that has different types of stats, like Crit, Haste, Expertise, and more.

Once you get a little bit higher in difficulty, you'll start to obtain the transmutation resources. This is kind of a crafting system where you can use transmutation resources and some of the gold you earn to transmute items that you've gotten that you don't need. It kind of functions like a bad luck protection thing for loot. If you keep getting the same cloak all the time, you can transmute those cloaks and if you're lucky, you can reroll them into something you actually need.

Then we also have scrapping loot, which gives you resources, and you can upgrade loot as well. One of the bigger systems is also once you get gems and sockets unlocked. We're doing a lot more with gems and sockets than most RPGs do, so it's not just stats on those gems. The gems also unlock new defensive abilities and offensive abilities, passive ones, props and stuff, and do some cool stuff with your character as well.

At the end of a dungeon, you get your loot for completing it. If you right-click on the chest, but you can click on your items to collect them, and on the right side, you can see what everybody in your party got.

'We're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that. One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes.'

Is there any way to trade these items if you don't need something and your friend does?

No trading yet. That'll be something we'll potentially look into as part of the live service.

How many heroes will be playable at launch?

We haven't set an exact number. It'll be somewhere around 8 or 9, maybe, at launch. Of course, we are planning to regularly release new heroes in live service as well as dungeons and adventures and other types of formats of playing as well eventually.

They are all limited to a single role, right?

Yes, we're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that.

One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes. Like, we could have a character that's a slime blob that clones into other heroes and can use their abilities for a while or any kind of stuff that we want to explore eventually. But we will be starting off with a good, strong foundation of heroes.

Why did you settle on a 4-player group format?

We even experimented with 3, but what we noticed is that when you go down to 3, you only have 1 because we really want to lean into the Holy Trinity, which is the tank healer DPS roles. When you have a party of 3, you're really losing like an X factor, a permutation of the kind of setups you can do with your team.

So, 4 felt like a good number, and just from playtesting, we felt like we're not missing anything with a group of 4 instead of 5. It still feels like we're able to give the same complexity. There's a sweet spot in terms of mechanics.

Is this going to be a shared world hub with more players than just your group?

Yes. Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub. If someone else logged in now, they would spawn here with us until we hit the cap for the stronghold and then a new one spins up.

Can you discuss what the post-launch would look like for Fellowship?

There's lots of stuff we could explore. We really want to build this game with our community. Part of us wanting to get it into the players' hands as soon as possible is for them to help us feel out, hey, what do we want? How do we make the best game for you? We're hoping to have a really close connection there.

What about monetization?

The plan is to be a premium game. It's not free to play; it's not subscription-based. It'll be premium. We're not in a rush to unravel a huge microtransaction plan from the very beginning. We're going to take it a little bit slow. We're not going to be selling anything that is content, so no dungeons, progression features, heroes, or anything like that.

We want to work with our community to understand, if you love this game, what makes sense for you all to spend money on so we can keep making this. The obvious stuff at the top of our list is skins, mounts, and little pets that follow you around.

'We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.'

Will there be any cosmetic customization of the heroes?

Yeah, we have a mirror behind the tree. This is just turned off right now, but of course, we will allow you to cosmetically change the way you look, which will probably be things you can get through microtransactions, but also, of course, the things that you're actually collecting, like the dungeon loot and all of that. We talked about hairstyles and stuff like that. I think there's more to explore there, but nothing final yet.

Would you add a dueling feature to Fellowship?

We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.

What about asymmetrical PvP, like doing simultaneous runs of the same dungeons to see who completes it first?

Yes, that kind of stuff, we're super interested in. We've talked about maybe a ghost mode where you can play even asymmetrically offline against other people's runs.

We talked about a live Tournament mode thing. We've talked about special game modes where you might be in the same map racing towards a boss. There's lots of cool stuff that we might do.

What about launching on consoles?

I'd say that's definitely very intimately connected to the gamepad support. So yeah, first, we would implement gamepad support. We don't have a date for when we would explore that, but we would do that first and then look at consoles.

Would you add story-based content to Fellowship?

That's a really good example that I consider not something that we would do unless the community clearly shows that that's what they would like.

If the community is like, hey, we really want a story adventure that focuses on letting us know more about our heroes, then cool, but initially, we're just really focused on the dungeon loop.

'Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub.'

What about larger group content, like raids?

Definitely. When we had our Closed Alpha in August, we forgot to remove the raids tab from our mission table. We're talking about raids. I think it is a natural step. It's the same there, though. It's not something that we're going to roll out from the very start. It's, I would say, one of the features that we're eyeing very intently.

But again, for the health of Fellowship in regards to balancing, I think it's really good to start with getting the 4-player format of dungeons out into the player's hands in the wild for a while so that we can make sure that we get all of the balancing and tuning knobs right and the progression systems starting to add those before we increase the complexity.

Increasing the amount of players you bring to a raid, maybe it's 8 players, maybe it's 12 - we want to do something a little bit smaller than the classical huge 40-man things because they're a mess to manage. But there's some added complexity even for 8 to 12 players, so I think it's healthy for us to make sure that we're delivering top-notch 4-player content before we get into that.

Will you add a guild system, too?

I think it's a pretty natural connection. There's nothing planned at launch, but we're going to listen to our community and figure out what kind of social tools they want. The way we approach what happens after early access is that we have a lot of ideas. We also have a lot of designs pretty fleshed out for various features. We've talked about raids, we've talked about guilds, there's a whole bunch of stuff.

I think it's important to have some kind of discourse with the community about exactly how we want to roll that out rather than us making up the next couple of years of features and then being kind of stuck delivering on that, and maybe after two weeks the players are saying we want something else. So, we're keeping things open. We really want to do this together with the community.

Latest Pixel 9a leak offers best look yet at display bezels and detailed specs [Gallery] - 9to5Google,"The latest Pixel 9a leak is one of the biggest yet, offering a closer look at the display bezels and the full specs of the device.",http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-pixel-9a-leak-display-bezels-detailed-specs/,technology,"Google’s Pixel 9a is coming out soon, and a new leak has officially detailed virtually everything about the device with a details rundown of the specs, pricing, and high-res pictures of all four colors.

We’ve already heard a lot about the Pixel 9a, but a new leak from WinFuture wraps everything up with a bow on top, providing a detailed look at the Pixel 9a specs and other key details.

That starts with the measurements of Google’s new mid-range smartphone, which have grown compared to the prior generation. Where the Pixel 8a measured in at 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9 mm, the Pixel 9a measures 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm. That makes room for a bigger battery – 5,100 mAh, as previously reported – as well as a bigger 6.3-inch display. The Pixel 8a had a 6.1-inch display. The new size more closely aligns with the standard Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro. The display carries a resolution of 2424×1080 with a 120Hz refresh rate and Gorilla Glass 3 on top. This is easily the best look we’ve had at the bezels, too, which are significantly larger than the rest of the Pixel 9 series. We previously had a peek at the bezels, but the wallpaper of the device somewhat obfuscated the size. Very similar renders hit the web last week, but at a lower resolution.

Remarkably, the Pixel 9a actually weighs less than the Pixel 8a, coming in at 185.9g to the Pixel 9a’s 188g.

A notable hardware upgrade is an IP68 dust/water resistance rating, up from IP67.

Under the hood, Google Tensor G4 runs the show (previously rumored to have a different modem from the rest of the Pixel 9 series) with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Android 15 is available at launch – making this the first Pixel release with Android 15 out of the box – with 7 years of OS updates.

The dual-camera array on the back, which ditches the iconic Pixel “camera bar” design, includes a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view. Another 13MP sensor is used for the front-facing camera. Rounding things out there’s wireless charging, NFC, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 6, satellite support, a fingerprint sensor, and face recognition.

The report also mentions a €499 price tag for the 128GB variant and €599 for the 256GB model, mirroring past leaks for the US. There’s no mention of a release date, though it’s been reported that Google will release this device in late March.

Finally, all four colors are also shown (as we saw earlier this month as well) again.

"Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on autos, chips and pharmaceuticals - CNN",President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/economy/us-new-tariff-plans-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,business,"CNN —

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.

Trump recently enacted a 10% across-board-tariff on goods coming from China and 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.

For tariffs on semiconductor chips and drugs, he told reporters at his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida that he intended to eventually increase the rate even more.

“It’ll go substantially higher over a course of a year,” he said. But he added that he wanted to give time for potentially affected companies to bring their factories to America to avoid tariffs.

“We want to give them a little bit of a chance,” he said.

The revelation comes days after Trump ordered an investigation into other nations’ tax and tariff policies, paving the way for new reciprocal tariffs to take effect as soon as April 2, the day after the investigation is set to conclude, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary said last week.

Trump’s latest announcement underscores his push for a more “balanced” trade with foreign markets and to reshore strategic industries. He has long criticized what he deems as unfair foreign treatment of US exports.

The steep new tariffs could have far-reaching effects, extending beyond the specific industries where taxes are levied, and hurt consumers with higher prices and businesses with increased costs, economists and industry experts have warned.

Consumers are expected to feel most of the burn by the new import taxes on automobiles, as prices of cars could jump by thousands of dollars, experts have warned. Nearly half of vehicle sales in the US last year, including cars and light trucks, were imported from foreign countries.

The president did not offer further details on whether the 25% tariff would be applied across the board to all countries or whether cars manufactured in Mexico and Canada under a free trade agreement Trump signed during his first term would be spared.

While US companies, like AI chipmaker Nvidia, dominate the semiconductor industry, manufacturing of chips has long been outsourced to Asia due to cost and technical reasons over the past decades. Nvidia declined to comment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pioneered the model of contract chipmaking, manufacturing chips for others without bearing its name, and it has emerged as the world’s largest contract chip producer.

TSMC told CNN that its chipmaking plants in Arizona, which were announced in 2020 during Trump’s first term, are on track as planned but declined to comment further.

Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of stealing America’s chip industry, a claim that experts dispute.

Though details remain unclear, new semiconductor tariffs could hurt Asian chip giants the most, including the likes of TSMC, South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix, whose manufacturing plants remain largely in Asia. The threat of new import taxes could also hasten the steps taken by these companies to set up shop or expand in the US.

As for the pharmaceutical industry, the US purchased more than $176 billion of drugs and related goods in 2023, according to US trade data, making it the largest importer of pharmaceutical products that year.

European, Indian and Chinese firms could be the hardest hit. In 2023, Ireland accounted for 20.4% of pharmaceutical imports, followed by 10.8% from Germany, 8.6% from Switzerland, 6.2% from India and 3.4% from China.",President Donald Trump said he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports.

UK inflation leaps to higher-than-expected 3% in January - CNBC,Economists polled by Reuters had expected a January reading of 2.8%.,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/uk-inflation-in-january-2025.html,business,"Fruit and veg stall Borough Market on 27th August 2024 in London, United Kingdom. Borough Market is a retail food market and farmers market in Southwark. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London, with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th century.

The U.K.'s inflation rate rose sharply to 3% in January, coming in above analyst expectations, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 2.8% in the twelve months to January.

Britain's consumer price index (CPI) fell to a lower-than-expected 2.5% in December, with core price growth also slowing further.

Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose by 3.7% in the 12 months to January, which was up from 3.2% in the previous month. Notably, the core services annual rate rose from 4.4% to 5.0%, the ONS said.

""Inflation increased sharply this month to its highest annual rate since March last year. The rise was driven by air fares not falling as much as we usually see at this time of year, partly impacted by the timing of flights over Christmas and New Year. This was the weakest January dip since 2020,"" Grant Fitzner, the ONS' chief economist, commented Wednesday.

""After falling this time last year, the cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks increased, particularly meat, bread and cereals. Private school fees were another factor, as new VAT [a sales tax] rules meant prices rose nearly 13% this month,"" he said, in comments on the X social media platform.

Responding to the latest data, U.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that delivering economic growth and ""getting more money in people's pockets"" were her priorities, while acknowledging that ""millions of families are still struggling to make ends meet.""

The British pound was little changed against the dollar following the data release, trading at $1.2615.","Britain's consumer price index (CPI) fell to a lower-than-expected 2.5% in December, with core price growth also slowing further.

Stock futures are little changed after S&P 500 clinches record high: Live updates - CNBC,Investors continue to largely shake off concerns around persistent inflation and tariffs.,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html,business,"The S&P 500 climbed to a fresh record on Wednesday as stocks remain resilient despite a continuously cautious Federal Reserve and President Donald Trump's threat of more tariffs.

The S&P 500 rose 0.24%, settling at 6,144.15 and earning its second record close in a row. The index also touched a fresh all-time high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.07% to close at 20,056.25, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 71.25 points, or 0.16%, to end at 44,627.59.

Shares of Microsoft gained 1.3% and led the broader technology sector higher after the company unveiled its first ever quantum computing chip. Tesla climbed almost 2%. Analog Devices surged nearly 10% after posting better-than-expected quarterly results on the top and bottom lines.

Trump on Tuesday floated the notion of imposing a 25% tariff on imported autos, chips and pharmaceuticals. Trump did not specify whether the potential duties would be targeted or broad, but did say they could be implemented as soon as April 2.

""I think there's a lot of noise tied to DOGE, Elon Musk and tariffs in the short-term, which is what you're seeing today. And I think a lot of this stuff will linger,"" said Jim Elios, founder and chief investment officer at Elios Financial Group. ""It's the Trump effect with headlines that are weighing on markets and causing some pain. In the long term, I'm still really bullish about how this can become a pro-business environment,"" added Elios.

Additionally, investors weighed the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed that central bank officials want to see more progress on inflation before cutting interest rates further, and they are also concerned about the effect of Trump's tariffs.

"US Postal Service head DeJoy to step down after 5 years marked by pandemic, losses and cost cuts - CNN","Louis DeJoy, the head of the US Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service c…",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/louis-dejoy-usps-postmaster-general-steps-down/index.html,business,"Washington AP —

Louis DeJoy, the head of the US Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.

In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor.

“As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation,” he wrote. “We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics.”

DeJoy took the helm of the postal service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump’s first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.

DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to “uncomfortable” rate hikes as the postal service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient.

The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery.

DeJoy has disputed that and told a US House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in “ratty” facilities and making other changes to create “a Postal Service for the future” that delivered mail more quickly.

DeJoy also oversaw the postal service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.

Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the postal service’s cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery.

"Argentine president defends his cryptocurrency tweet after crash, comparing losses to gambling - CNN","Argentine President Javier Milei has defended himself for promoting a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch, likening those who invested in the token after his endorsement to gamblers at casinos.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/americas/argentina-milei-defends-libra-crypto-tweet-intl-latam/index.html,business,"CNN —

Argentine President Javier Milei has defended himself for promoting a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch, likening those who invested in the token after his endorsement to gamblers at casinos.

“The reality is if you go to the casino and lose money, I mean, what is the claim if you knew that it had those characteristics?” he said during an interview with the TN news channel that aired on Monday night.

Milei said he promoted the little-known crypto coin $LIBRA in a tweet on X last week because he believed it would encourage economic growth by funding small businesses.

“I am spreading the word that this is to fund Argentines who do projects and who do not have access to financing,” he told TN.

The price of the coin soared after the president’s endorsement then quickly collapsed, leading to losses for thousands of investors.

Milei deleted his tweet hours after posting it, saying he had doubts about the matter.

Critics have called for Milei’s impeachment and filed multiple criminal complaints against the president, including at least one to the US Department of Justice, alleging an illicit association to commit “an indeterminate number of frauds.”

One complaint against the president, the developers of the cryptocurrency and other named individuals was filed by the Popular Unity political party and others. It alleged that “The biggest MEGA scam in history in this sector was carried out through an operation known as ‘Rugpull’ which occurs when the developers behind a project launch a token and attract investors to increase its value, then abruptly withdraw and take the money.”

The plaintiffs said Monday that a judge has been appointed to look into the complaint.

CNN has reached out to the token’s developers for comment on the case.

On Saturday, the firm behind the launch, Kelsier, rejected claims that the project’s backers were scammers.

Asked if he thought he had made a mistake, Milei told TN, “No, because I also acted in good faith.”

Milei insisted that anyone who invested in the coin did so voluntarily, despite his tweet.

“I did not promote it. What I did was I spread it,” he said, adding that he did not benefit from the crypto coin.",Argentine President Javier Milei defended himself for promoting a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch.

DOGE Reportedly Cuts FDA Employees Investigating Neuralink - Gizmodo,"The FDA previously found Musk's company was engaging in ""objectionable conditions or practices.""",https://gizmodo.com/doge-reportedly-cuts-fda-employees-investigating-neuralink-2000565213,business,"The purging of federal employees carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) somehow just keeps cutting staffers involved in investigating Elon Musk’s companies. According to a report from Reuters, several employees at the US Food and Drug Administration who were tasked with managing reviews and applications related to Musk’s Neuralink received pink slips over the weekend.

Per Reuters, 20 people who worked in the FDA’s office of neurological and physical medicine devices got axed as part of a broader effort being carried out by DOGE to cut down the federal workforce. Several of those employees worked directly on Neuralink, Musk’s company that produces brain-computer interfaces designed to be implanted in a human brain, and were tasked with reviewing clinical trial applications.

While the sources Reuters spoke to said they did not think those employees were specifically targeted, the reduction of workers within the medical devices office isn’t going to make things any easier for companies like Neuralink, which likely wants to see the approval process speed up. Fewer people to approve applications either means that the process slows down even more or corners get cut. Take a guess at which of those options Musk likely prefers.

Targeted or not, it’s noteworthy just how frequently people involved in regulating Musk-owned companies are getting hit by DOGE-initiated layoffs. According to a report from the New York Times, at least 11 federal agencies targeted by DOGE cuts have ongoing actions related to Musk’s firms—a total of 32 investigations, complaints, and enforcement actions that seem likely to either grind to a halt or disappear as a result of staff reductions.

Neuralink in particular seems to have benefited from efforts to squash watchdogs. Last month, the Inspector General at the US Department of Agriculture had to be removed from her office by security after refusing to comply with her termination, which she believed was illegal. She happened to be heading up an investigation into Neuralink looking into whether the company was violating animal welfare rules related to its tests on animal subjects.

The FDA, too, has been looking into similar issues. Last year, the agency found that Neuralink’s animal labs engaged in “objectionable conditions or practices” and urged the company to address the issues—but did not issue any punitive actions related to the investigation.

Neuralink and the FDA also had a standoff over allowing the company to move forward with human trials, a request that the FDA rejected over safety risks in 2022 before finally allowing limited trials to move forward a year later. In 2024, the FDA even gave Neuralink its “breakthrough device” designation, which allows for a speedier review process. The only thing faster might be no review at all.",Several employees at the US Food and Drug Administration who were tasked with managing reviews and applications related to Musk’s Neuralink received pink slips over the weekend.

I Just Figured Out What Elon Musk’s DOGE Really Is - Slate,It’s how things worked when you went to the Cosa Nostra to ask for protection for you and your family in exchange for some portion of your own resources.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-trump-mafia-dahlia-lithwick.html,business,"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.

Late last month, amid the utter chaos of Donald Trump’s first two weeks back in office, there was a revelatory moment during a press conference by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that was intended ostensibly to explain Trump’s attempted, then rescinded, across-the-board budget freeze. During that presser, Leavitt tried to explain which services might come back online and how. Instead, she inadvertently revealed that what’s really been going on with these budget cuts is the widespread institutionalization of the sort of organized-crime approach that Trump has brought to every aspect of his professional, political, and presidential life.

In order to explain the very first effort to dismantle the federal government by way of impounding federal funds and shutting off the spigot for trillions of dollars across thousands of federal programs—funds already appropriated by Congress—​​Leavitt tried to calm the roiling waters around a spending freeze that was likely to halt funding to Head Start, foreign aid, HIV programs, Meals on Wheels, and other vital services. Leavitt tried to soothe these vital institutions and programs with the promise that anyone who was worried about their own parochial interests should just pick up a phone and call the incoming head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, to ask for special favors and exemptions. As Leavitt described it, she had been in contact with Vought that very morning, “and he told me to tell all of you that the line to his office is open for other federal government agencies across the board, and if they feel that programs are necessary and in line with the president’s agenda, then the Office of Management and Budget will review those policies.”

The line struck me at the time as a strange and ominous admission: Sure, we have arbitrarily defunded the government as you have come to understand it, but just hop on the phone with the as-yet-unconfirmed OMB director (he has since been confirmed), plead your case, and he might just do you a little favor. In the blur of the will-they-won’t-they OMB memo rescission and the subsequent lawsuits, it was easy to miss that mobsters dole out services in precisely this fashion. Governments typically do not.

That certainly isn’t how any of this is meant to work. It’s how things worked during, say, the Renaissance, when you went with your rakish peasant hat in hand to the Medicis and asked them for special favors in exchange for your pony or your eldest daughter. It’s how things worked when you went to the Cosa Nostra to ask for protection for you and your family in exchange for some portion of what was in your cash register. When we think of the DOGE takeover of the federal government solely as an act of smash-and-grab vandalism, we are just slightly missing the endgame, which is to sell us back those stolen goods and services in exchange for our loyalty. That is, of course, a protection racket. And it’s precisely the point.

This whole racket of theirs has already begun to affect all of us. On Monday, a Delta Airlines flight made an emergency landing upside down at Toronto’s Pearson Airport, a few short hours after hundreds of firings at the Federal Aviation Administration, the most recent in a string of stunning plane crashes in recent weeks. The pink slips were reportedly sent out “without cause nor based on performance or conduct,” with the emails originating “from an ‘exec order’ Microsoft email address”—not a government email address. Whether it is Elon Musk or DOGE or a postpubescent coder firing the probationary staff at the FAA in some sense matters far less than the fact that a team from Musk’s SpaceX spent Monday visiting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, in Virginia, to assist in overhauling the system. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced on Musk’s platform X that Musk’s DOGE team would “plug in” to the FAA to help “upgrade our aviation system.” I’m pretty sure that when the guy breaking your storefront windows is the same guy selling you replacement plate glass, you are not, in fact, witnessing the free market doing its best work.

In one sense, the protection-racket model works so well in the present moment because it also appeals to the foundational NIMBY ethos that holds that cutting everyone else’s government services is fine, so long as your narrow interests are protected. The raft of tweets, posts, and articles about the Trump-loving folks who absolutely support the MAGA vandalism of the federal government but never believed that it would come for them is its own small carnival of leopards and face-eatings. But isn’t the really chilling part not that they are surprised, but that they believe they can still find a way to be exempted from it? And of course they should be exempt. But they should also not have been targeted for budget cuts and cruelty in the first place. And they assuredly should not be forced to throw themselves on the mercy of the state to be made whole for their losses.

In heartbreaking recent reporting by the Washington Post about Luke Graziani, a disabled Army veteran terminated Friday, when he was just five weeks from completing his probation year at the Bronx Veterans Affairs hospital, two details stood out to me: When he printed out his termination letter, blaming his dismissal on poor performance, and took it to his supervisor, Graziani’s boss immediately promised to submit a request for exemption. “You’re critical staff,” Graziani recalled his boss saying. “We’re going to try.”

It didn’t end there, notes the Post. Graziani, who is 45 and has four children, “had believed until this weekend that his veteran status would protect his job. He served 20 years in the Army, first as a supply specialist and then in public affairs, deploying for two tours in Iraq and another two in Afghanistan before retiring in 2023.” So he sat down and wrote a letter to the new Veterans Affairs secretary, Douglas A. Collins, who had vowed in his confirmation hearing, “We will not stop until we succeed on behalf of the men and women who have worn the uniform.” He wanted Collins to give him his job back. Collins, it seems, has not yet replied. But might we agree that nobody should have to be put in the position of selling themselves back to their employers any more than they should be buying the spark plugs that the government just stripped from their own cars?

In the event that this is not all perfectly transparent, consider the tragic case of New York Mayor Eric Adams, whose continued time in office stands for no august legal principle save for the oldest one in the book: I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine. (That’s neither legal nor a principle, by the way.) It is how power works when power acts outside the boundaries of the law—you are spared bad consequences the very moment you fall in line, and by falling in line, you become part of the machinery that oppresses those who cannot or will not pay for the same protections.

It should be axiomatic, for anyone who actually flies commercial airlines, drinks water, gets diseases, and sends their children to schools, that most people will need those things to be provided by the government. The current plan is to ensure that you wake up in the morning and read Elon Mail, drink Elon Water, and attend Elon School while you rely on SpaceX and Tesla for all your needs, and you will pay for all that using the financial instrument of Elon’s choosing.

For anyone who has spent hours on the phone, navigating the byzantine forms and rules of the modern health care, educational, and student loan systems in immense frustration, please be prepared. Whatever else those entities did, they didn’t lead with “What can you give me in exchange?” They do now.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt inadvertently revealed what's really been going on with budget cuts.

BYU hands No. 23 Kansas back-to-back losses with 3rd straight win - KSL.com,"Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers, and BYU shot 53% from the field in a wire-to-wire rout of the Jayhawks.",https://www.ksl.com/article/51256357/byu-hands-no-23-kansas-back-to-back-losses-with-3rd-straight-win,sports,"Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

PROVO — At the end of the night, the Kansas men's basketball team will return to Lawrence Regional Airport with as many minutes led in a basketball game in the Beehive State as when the Jayhawks started their two-game road trip.

Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers, and BYU shot 53% from the field in a wire-to-wire rout of the Jayhawks in a 91-57 win in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 17,978 fans at the Marriott Center.

Trevin Knell added 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists for the Cougars (18-7, 9-6 Big 12), and Mawot Mag scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting for a BYU squad that shot 55.9% from the perimeter.

Dallin Hall supplied 10 points and eight assists, and Keba Keita added 10 points, nine rebounds, two steals and two thunderous blocks that blew the roof off the gym. Was it the best game — or at least, most complete — of the season for BYU, which won its third straight and seventh in the last nine games?

""I think so,"" BYU coach Kevin Young said. ""And we picked a good night to do it.""

Boy, did they.

The win puts the Cougars alone in fifth place in the Big 12 Conference with five games remaining — and three of them on the road, including Saturday at No. 19 Arizona (8 p.m. MST, ESPN). There's also that tricky road spot March 4 at No. 8 Iowa State.

So Tuesday's win was significant for many reasons.

""I feel like this is just a continuation of the past couple of games,"" said Knell, who shot 4-of-7 from 3-point range — one of four players with multiple triples among BYU's 14 makes. ""This is just another team win that we're stacking; every day in practice, we're competing and it's showing out on the court.

""It's a great team win, and I feel like it was a statement.""

The Jayhawks return to Lawrence, Kansas, having not led for 40 consecutive minutes en route to losses in three of their last four games and four of their last six. It's the first time Kansas has lost by at least 30 points to an unranked opponent since the Associated Press first began ranking teams in 1938, according to the AP.

Hunter Dickinson had 12 points and 14 rebounds for Kansas (17-9, 8-7 Big 12), which lost back-to-back games for the first time all year.

""They whooped us today,"" Dickinson said. ""They beat us by 36; I don't think there's anything personal about that. That's just one team that came out to play, and one team didn't.""

BYU couldn't have started much better, with an 8-0 jump that included the 215th career 3-pointer and 1,000th point by Knell.

Mag had 7 points in the first seven minutes, capping a 14-2 run to put the Cougars up 22-7 and forced Kansas coach Bill Self to use his second timeout.

""I thought we were awful, and I thought they were great. I think BYU could've beaten anybody tonight,"" said Self, whose 34-point loss was one of the worst since he was named head coach in 2003 and the third-worst defeat in the program's storied history. ""They were great — and we didn't do anything to make them play less than great.

""Our offense stunk, but that wasn't it,"" he added. ""We couldn't stop them, or get any momentum to stop them.""

But it didn't get much better.

Saunders poured in 14 points on a perfect 5-for-5 shooting, including four 3-pointers, and Knell canned four triples for 13 points as the Cougars shot 46.9% from the field with 10 3-pointers en route to a 46-26 halftime advantage.

BYU led by as much as 38 points midway in the second half, and never took its foot off the gas. The Cougars out-rebounded the Jayhawks 43-33, scored 15 points off 15 turnovers and assisted on 24-of-34 made field goals including five assists from Egor Demin.

""I think we're just hitting our stride right now at the right time of the year, playing our best brand of basketball,"" Hall said. ""We're less concerned with the opponent in front of us, and more concerned with executing our side of things: the game plan on both sides. I thought we did a really good job of that. We're hitting our stride, and trying to put the country on notice.""",Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers.

"2025 NFL free agency: Ranking top 25 offensive free agents with plenty of veteran receivers, O-linemen - CBS Sports","If you are looking for some offensive line help, there's plenty to choose from",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-nfl-free-agency-ranking-top-25-offensive-free-agents-with-plenty-of-veteran-receivers-o-linemen/,sports,"The 2024 NFL season is officially in the rearview mirror, and 31 teams around the league will spend the next seven months trying to improve their rosters to compete with the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, while the Eagles themselves will try to maintain their position as the best roster in football.

The first stage in the offseason player-acquisition process is free agency, which begins in just a few weeks. For a few days in the beginning of March, there will be a massive spending spree around the NFL, and it's likely that a lot of players on our list of the top offensive free agents below will become significantly richer men.

Speaking of, the top 25 offensive free agents are ...

Higgins is expected to be franchise tagged for a second straight year, technically taking him off the open market, but we've seen before that franchise-tagged players are gettable if you're willing to offer enough draft capital and an appropriate contract. If the Bengals won't pay him what he's worth, then there will be some team willing to meet the price on both fronts -- and in that case, he remains the top available player.

Smith is pretty clearly the next-best available player, and he's almost surely going to be playing for a new team next season due to Kansas City's cap situation. Any team looking for an interior lineman should be looking his way first. There are other players available at the position, though, with a bunch of depth at guard in particular: Fries, Zeitler, Becton, Jenkins, Martin, Daniels and Scherff are all quality starters. Some of them have age (Zeitler, Martin, Scherff) or injury (Becton, Martin) issues that could hold them back from being their best selves, but there is a lot of depth among the group either way.

2025 NFL free agency: Ranking top 25 defensive players; three from Super Bowl champion Eagles headline list Garrett Podell

The same is true of receiver, by the way. Godwin and Diggs are each coming off significant knee injuries, but both showed this season that they can still play at a high level. There's less risk in Godwin because he's younger, but Diggs might cost less due to the age/injury combination. Even beyond those two players, though, there is a lot of depth on the receiver market.

Both Chiefs wideouts are available this offseason, and it might not cost that much to get them considering their own age (Hopkins) and injury (Brown) issues. Hollywood could be a really good buy low for somebody in the same way he made for a smart bet for the Chiefs this past year, only to have the dice roll come up snake eyes due to his preseason shoulder injury. Cooper didn't make much of an impact upon his arrival in Buffalo and that might drive his price down, but he was terrific in Cleveland the last couple years and had a personal issue derail some of his time with the Bills, which at least partially explains the drop in playing time and production. Then there's Allen, who is clearly not the same physically as he once was, but can still be a reliable underneath target in the slot. You'll want to limit his playing time and make sure he's not your top option in the passing game, but he can help.

The running back market isn't great, but it's not terrible. Harris and Jones can still be part of backfield rotations, and players like Rico Dowdle and J.K. Dobbins will also be out there. Raheem Mostert was just released and will be available as well, and some team might want to take a shot on trying to recapture what Javonte Williams was early in his rookie contract, before his injury.

The quarterback class is ... not great. Darnold may have cost himself a significant amount of money with his performances in Week 18 and the first round of the playoffs, but he is still the top option out there. He may not get a long-term deal anymore, though, and may now be viewed as more of a mid-tier bridge quarterback than surefire starter. After him, you can take your pick of Steelers quarterbacks. There's not much upside in Wilson anymore so Fields seems like the better bet to me, but the league might not see it that way. If you miss out on those guys, there's always young players like Trey Lance, Mac Jones and Zach Wilson, or long-term backups like Jacoby Brissett and Marcus Mariota.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Do ODIs have a future?

The contenders

As the sun rises over the bustling streets of Karachi on Wednesday, cricket enthusiasts around the globe will hold their breath in anticipation. The ICC Champions Trophy makes its return after an eight-year hiatus, bringing together the sport’s top eight teams in a three-week cricketing carnival.This time, the stakes are even higher — Pakistan will host an elite ICC competition for the first time since the 1996 ODI World Cup. A nation that has long yearned to host premier ICC events will finally get its moment in the spotlight. There is an important caveat though – India’s matches are going to be played in Dubai, UAE, which has been made an additional venue besides Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. The hybrid model introduced due to India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan adds complexity to the whole affair.Pakistan, incidentally, are the defending champions, having beaten India in the final of the previous edition in 2017. The tournament features eight teams – divided into two groups of four – with Group A comprising Pakistan, India, New Zealand and Bangladesh. Group B constitutes Australia, South Africa, Afghanistan and England.The tournament kicks off with Pakistan and New Zealand clashing at Karachi’s National Stadium on Wednesday. Notably, two former champions, Sri Lanka and West Indies, failed to qualify. This edition, interestingly, also marks Afghanistan’s first appearance in the Champions Trophy The format adds another layer of intrigue. With just three group games per team, there’s no time to ease into the competition. Every match carries massive significance, and net run-rate could prove crucial.The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals on March 4 and 5. The final is scheduled for March 9 at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium but may shift to Dubai if India qualify.What makes the Champions Trophy particularly special is its unforgiving nature. Unlike the ODI World Cup, where teams can recover from early setbacks, here every match feels like a knockout game. One rain-affected match, one brilliant individual performance or one crucial toss decision could determine a team’s fate. It's this knife-edge nature that makes every match compelling viewing.The conditions in Pakistan and UAE add another layer of intrigue to the tournament. February temperatures should be relatively comfortable but evening dew could potentially impact day-night encounters. The pitches in both Pakistan and UAE are traditionally known for their batting-friendly nature, but spinners are likely to get assistance too. Teams will need to be tactically flexible, ready to adapt their strategies as conditions evolve.There are rivalries, and then there is the India vs Pakistan clash , cricket’s marquee contest. Set to take place in Dubai due to political considerations, this clash on February 23 remains the most anticipated fixture of the tournament.The stakes are high for both the teams as fans from both the sides are expected to flock to the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. While it’s going to be yet another battle between India’s batting and Pakistan’s bowling, the absence of Jasprit Bumrah is going to play a crucial factor in which way the eventual result pans out.All eyes will be on two of cricket’s biggest stars, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. With both players nearing the twilight of their careers, this tournament may very well mark their last appearance together on the ODI stage.The Champions Trophy presents a golden opportunity for the duo to sign off in style. Winning an ICC ODI trophy has been a long-cherished dream for both, given India’s near misses in the last decade. A title triumph would not only add another feather to their cap but also serve as the perfect farewell to a format they have dominated for so long.Australia are perhaps the most affected team, missing their entire frontline pace attack. Captain Pat Cummins is sidelined with an ankle injury while Josh Hazlewood is managing ongoing hip issues. Mitchell Starc has withdrawn from the tournament for personal reasons and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh is out due to a lower-back injury. The sudden retirement of Marcus Stoinis has further depleted their squad.India will also feel the absence of star bowler Bumrah, who is recovering from a lower back injury.South Africa face similar woes, with key pacers like Anrich Nortje and Gerald Coetzee ruled out due to injuries. New Zealand pacers Lockie Ferguson and Ben Sears also have been ruled out. Other teams like Pakistan, England and Afghanistan are not immune to these injury woes either.The cumulative effect of these injuries could potentially dampen the spirit of the tournament.The tournament will also serve as a fascinating barometer of where ODI cricket stands in 2025. In an era increasingly dominated by T20 cricket and with Test cricket maintaining its traditional appeal, what the 50-over format brings to the plate would be interesting to see.Several tactical trends are likely to emerge during the tournament. The middle overs, often considered the less dramatic phase of ODI cricket, might prove decisive.Predicting a winner is not easy. However, home advantage makes Pakistan a strong contender, while Australia’s penchant for ICC trophies means they can never be ignored.India and South Africa's depth in all departments make both teams formidable. Afghanistan have shed their underdogs label and held their own in the last two ICC events. With spin likely to play an important role, Afghanistan are surely the dark horses for a semifinal spot","The ICC Champions Trophy makes its return after an eight-year hiatus.

Kevin Durant explains why he nixed Warriors trade at NBA deadline - New York Post ,"Kevin Durant revealed why he did not want to run to return to the Bay Area, and it had nothing to do with his past experiences with the Warriors.",https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/sports/kevin-durant-explains-why-he-nixed-warriors-trade-at-nba-deadline/,sports,"Kevin Durant revealed why he did not want to run to return to the Bay Area, and it had nothing to do with his past experiences with the Warriors.

Durant, 36, nixed a three-team deal before the NBA’s trade deadline earlier in February that would have sent him to the Warriors.

Warriors head coach Steve Kerr had speculated that it had to do with the “s–t” he took his first time around, but Durant told ESPN on Tuesday that it was a much simpler reason.

“People talk crazy about me all the time,” Durant said. “That’s not the reason why I didn’t want to come back, I just didn’t want to get traded midway through the season. It was nothing against my time with the Warriors, or I heard because I don’t like Draymond [Green]. At the end of the day, I just didn’t want to move and I wanted to see it through with my team in Phoenix and see what we could do the rest of this season. I’m glad I’m still there.”

Durant’s comments came after Kerr spoke on the topic with ESPN last week.

“I don’t blame Kevin one bit for not wanting to rerun things here,” Kerr told the outlet. “He took so much s–t for like, ‘Oh, you’re jumping on the bandwagon.’ And then he’s Finals MVP two years in a row. It’s like he still gets criticized.”

It was previously reported that the deal would have involved the Warriors, Suns and Heat.

The Warriors ended up turning their attention to Jimmy Butler after the deal for Durant fell apart.

"Vincent Kompany delighted with Bayern Munich’s 1-1 draw with Celtic, all things considered - Bavarian Football Works","On paper, a 1-1 draw vs. Celtic isn’t much, but Bayern Munich is now through to the Champions League round of 16.",https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2025/2/19/24366999/bayern-munich-celtic-uefa-champions-league-vincent-kompany-reaction-win-alphonso-davies-kuhn-ucl,sports,"They made incredibly hard work of it, but thanks to a late, stoppage time goal from substitute Alphonso Davies, Bayern Munich drew Celtic 1-1 at the Allianz Arena and went through 3-2 on aggregate in the Champions League playoff round. Vincent Kompany’s side is now officially through to the round of 16 of the competition after doing enough in the home and away leg, but it was heartbreak for Celtic when Davies poked in a saved Leon Goretzka header by Kasper Schmeichel in the 94th minute.

On the overall balance, Bayern dominated most of the statistics on the match sheet, but Celtic certainly made life rather difficult for the Rekordmeister. Nicolas Kühn, capitalizing on a mistake at the back from Bayern’s Josip Stanišić, and a failed tackle from Kim Min-jae was arguably a deserved reward for Celtic. By no means was Brendan Rodgers’ side just sitting back and defending for the entire match, but the levy was bound to break with the amount of chances Bayern was throwing Schmeichel’s way, especially after Kühn’s goal.

Speaking after the match, Kompany put things into context. The two legs against Celtic might not have been anywhere near Bayern at their best, but they are still top of the Bundesliga and on to the next round of the Champions League after a tough stretch of fixtures. For him, how his side fared from the past six days has been up to snuff.

“It was a hard-fought draw, I thought we had many chances in the second half to score two-to-three goals. The context is important, we spent a lot of energy in the past six days. In the end, we’re 8 points ahead in the league and we’ve advanced to the next round in the Champions League. We now have some time to recover. Of course we always want to dominate and be much better than the opponent, especially here at Allianz Arena. But the result is always the most important thing. We’ll learn from this game. As I said, we have to look at the context, we played too many games. We fought hard three days ago in Leverkusen, and six days ago at Celtic Park to get the result that helped us today,” the Belgian manager explained (via @iMiaSanMia).

Naturally, there will be a level of relief for Kompany, whether he wants to admit it or not. Despite being ahead by a decent margin in the Bundesliga, having already been knocked out of the DFB-Pokal brings added weight to the Champions League. Had they not made it past the playoffs against Celtic, serious questions would have to be asked, regardless of what the context was.

TGL results: Tiger Woods makes 'embarrassing' mistake as Jupiter Links GC gets routed by New York Golf Club - CBS Sports,"Woods is usually on his game, but neither he nor Jupiter Links were in the zone on Tuesday night in the fourth TGL match across two days",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/tgl-results-tiger-woods-makes-embarrassing-mistake-as-jupiter-links-gc-gets-routed-by-new-york-golf-club/,sports,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods had 199 yards to the hole. His Jupiter Links GC teammates realized too late that something was dreadfully wrong Tuesday night in a TGL indoor match.

Woods asked to confirm the yardage and heard 99 -- caddies often drop the first number when it's obvious. But it apparently wasn't obvious to Woods.

He hit wedge, a perfectly good shot that traveled 100 yards.

""I heard 99 yards, so I went out there and hit it,"" the 15-time major champion said after losing the 13th hole against Cameron Young of New York Golf Club.

""One of the most embarrassing moment in my golfing career just happened,"" Woods said on the ESPN telecast, laughing among the disbelief. ""I just screwed up. That was embarrassing.""

His Jupiter Links teammates, Kevin Kisner and Tom Kim, dropped to the floor laughing.

"Tiger Woods, Jupiter Lose TGL Matchup as Fans Applaud Rickie Fowler, NYGC's 1st Win - Bleacher Report",,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25157984-tiger-woods-jupiter-lose-tgl-matchup-fans-applaud-rickie-fowler-nygcs-1st-win,sports,"New York Golf Club is in the win column.

NYGC notched its first win of the inaugural TGL season with a 10-3 victory over Tiger Woods and Jupiter Links Golf Club on Tuesday at SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

Rickie Fowler, Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick propelled NYGC to 1-2 through three matches, while Woods, Tom Kim, Kevin Kisner and JLGC dropped to the same record and was unable to build any momentum after its previous win over Boston Common Golf.

Notably, Tuesday marked Woods' return to golf after he announced he would not play in last week's Genesis Invitational following the death of his mother, Kultida Woods, who died on Feb. 4 at the age of 80.

The 15-time major champion was unable to lead his team to victory upon his return, but the match still drew plenty of social-media reaction:

Tuesday's format had the teams compete in triples for the first nine holes before six one-hole singles matches. Teammates alternated shots in the triples format with drives and iron shots into the simulator and chips and putts on the putting green.

The addition of the Hammer rule also created another variable.

While holes were each worth one point, each team was given three Hammers to use over the course of the match. If a Hammer was thrown and accepted, the value of the hole increased by one point. That meant a hole could be worth as many as three points if both teams threw and accepted Hammers.

It took a Hammer to give JLGC its first momentum after a difficult start.

Kim drilled a putt on the final hole of triples to make it 8-2 after NYGC came storming out of the gates. Perhaps it was something Pete Alonso told them ahead of the match, as the New York Mets star led them out for pregame introductions before the victors jumped out to a commanding 8-0 lead through the first eight holes.

To Woods' credit, he helped JLGC build on the Hammer momentum by draining a birdie to win the first one-hole singles point. However, Fowler answered right back with a birdie of his own as NYGC made sure there wasn't much drama down the stretch.

Perhaps the most entertaining moment of the evening came when Woods thought he was 99 yards away on the 13th hole when he was actually 199 yards away. He pulled out a wedge and hit it well short, which led to plenty of laughter from his teammates.

Woods joked on the ESPN broadcast that it was one of the most embarrassing moments of his golfing career as the laid-back and entertaining style of TGL took center stage.","New York Golf Club defeats Jupiter Links Golf Club 10-3.

ABS challenge system to feature in spring games - ESPN,Thirteen spring stadiums and over 60% of Cactus and Grapefruit League games will feature an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system.,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/43911443/spring-training-games-feature-automated-ball-strike-challenge-system,sports,"Open Extended Reactions

PHOENIX -- Thirteen spring stadiums and over 60% of Cactus and Grapefruit League games will feature an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system as MLB continues to inch closer to using it during the regular season -- though that won't occur any earlier than 2026.

The league is testing out the system at the big league level for the first time after years of experimenting with ABS in the minor leagues. The rules are as follows:

• During the spring, each team will be given two challenges per game and will retain successful challenges.

• Only the batter, catcher or pitcher can initiate a challenge, which must happen immediately after the umpire's call. The player must quickly tap his hat or helmet to indicate a challenge.

• The results of the challenge will be displayed on the scoreboard and television broadcast to communicate whether a call was overturned or not.

The five dual-team stadiums in Arizona -- Seattle Mariners/San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox/Los Angeles Dodgers, Kansas City Royals/Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds/Cleveland Guardians and Colorado Rockies/Arizona Diamondbacks -- will all have the system in use this spring.

The same is true for the eight teams that play in Florida -- Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals/Miami Marlins.

Every game in each of the above stadiums will employ the challenge system. The league plans to gather data throughout the spring in hopes of determining whether the system is ready to bring to the major league level a year from now.

Additionally, Triple-A baseball will employ the challenge system during the 2025 regular season, giving the league as much information as possible before a decision is made on 2026.

League officials are encouraging players to use the system liberally throughout spring training. After years of experimenting with ABS in the minors, the league determined that both players and fans prefer a challenge system to having every pitch call be automated.

The league believes a challenge system would be less disruptive while retaining the human elements of the game, including pitch framing by catchers.

The league says a challenge takes about 17 seconds to complete. Experiments in the minor leagues showed an overturn rate of about 50%. On average, there were 3.9 challenges per game during minor league testing.

After collecting data, including talking to players, coaches and umpires throughout the spring, and evaluating the Triple-A regular season, the league's competition committee will determine if ABS becomes a reality in Major League Baseball's regular season and postseason.

The first game to feature the challenge system will be between the Dodgers and Cubs on Thursday at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona.","The league is testing out the system at the big league level for the first time.

"Matt Eberflus has a plan for Micah Parsons, hopes to make him even better - NBC Sports",Micah Parsons is a defensive end.,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/matt-eberflus-has-a-plan-for-micah-parsons-hopes-to-make-him-even-better,sports,"Micah Parsons is a defensive end.

After Parsons played 55.2 percent of his snaps at linebacker as a rookie, the Cowboys have used him almost exclusively as a defensive end. He has played under two different coordinators and now a third in 2025 in his five seasons.

Not much will change in 2025, even though Parsons called it “challenging” to have to learn a new system under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.

“Micah is a premium pass rusher,” Eberflus said Tuesday, via Garrett Podell of CBS Sports. “We’re going to use him that way certainly. He’s a heck of an athlete and doing a lot of different things for us on defense. When you have a guy like that, you want to be able to utilize his skill set. As we’re around him more, we’ll be able to see what that skill set is and really take advantage of that.”

Parsons has double-digit sacks in each of his first four seasons and 52.5 for his career.

He has had only a brief phone conversation with Eberflus, and the two might not see each other until Parsons has a contract extension, which could take some time. Either way, though, Eberflus knows how good Parsons is and will try to put him in position to make him even better.

“I can’t really talk much football at this time of year with the guys, just kind of talk with him more personally what he was doing,” Eberflus said. “I think he was at Disney with his kids at the time. He knows that we’ll adjust to make him in the best light that he can be in in terms of position, in terms of pass rush. Really utilizing what he does best and that’s rushing the passer.”",Micah Parsons played 55.2 percent of his snaps at linebacker as a rookie.

"Virginia Women Shatter NCAA Record in the 800 Free Relay, Now Hold All 5 NCAA Relay Marks - SwimSwam",Gretchen Walsh led off Virginia's 800 free relay with the second-fastest 200 free in history; from there the Cavaliers never looked back to the record line.,https://swimswam.com/virginia-women-shatter-ncaa-record-in-the-800-free-relay-now-hold-all-5-ncaa-relay-marks/,sports,"2025 ACC MEN’S & Women’s SWIMMING AND DIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS

One of the perks of dominance, in swimming, is the ability for a team like Virginia to sub-optimize their conference championship lineup in order to make a point, and that’s just what they did on Tuesday evening in Greensboro at the ACC Championships.

They pulled their biggest names out of the 200 medley relay (though that relay still included Junior National Teamers and an Olympia, Emma Weber), and stuffed them all into the 800 free relay – historically Virginia’s weakest.

The result was a dismantling of the U.S. Open and NCAA Records in the 800 free relay with a 6:44.13. That broke the old mark of 6:45.91 that was set at the 2017 NCAA Championships by Stanford with a legendary relay of their own.

Virginia stacked up Gretchen Walsh, Alex Walsh, Aimee Canny, and Claire Curzan on Tuesday evening.

Walsh, who has been as hot as anyone has ever been in short course over the last 18 months, split 1:39.35 on the opening leg. That’s a new ACC Record and the second-fastest 200 yard freestyle in history behind only Missy Franklin‘s 1:39.10 from the 2015 NCAA Championships.

She was followed by her sister Alex (1:41.87), Aimee Canny (1:42.03), and a transfer-from-Stanford Claire Curzan (1:40.89), who is in her first season on the varsity but her second season training with the Cavaliers.

What is remarkable is that, including the leadoff leg, Virginia had the four fastest splits of the entire field. The next-fastest was from NC State freshman Erika Pelaez, who rolled a 1:42.28 on their 4th-place relay.

The old Stanford relay, which included Olympic medalists Katie Ledecky, Lia Neal, and Simone Manuel, plus individual NCAA Record breaker Ella Eastin, retains the American Record because Virginia’s Canny is from South Africa.

Splits Comparison:

Virginia’s focus has never really been on the 800 free relay. For several years in a row, they haven’t raced it at their mid-season invite, waiting until the ACC Championships to get a time on the board, and when they do race it, they rarely use their best lineup.

And yet, they have now won the 800 free relay at the ACCs every year since 2007 – a streak that long predates the current generation of the program.

But this performance is a gigantic flex, and makes Virginia the first program since Stanford in 2019 to hold all five NCAA relay records simultaneously (Cal broke their 400 free relay record on March 1 at the 2019 Pac-12 Championships). That Stanford team won three consecutive NCAA titles, and this Virginia team is barreling toward its 5th.

"Sources: Team USA, Bruins’ Charlie McAvoy is week-to-week after procedure to clear infection - Daily Faceoff",McAvoy was ruled out of Thursday’s 4 Nations Face-Off winner-take-all championship game against Canada.,https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/news/sources-team-usa-boston-bruins-charlie-mcavoy-is-week-to-week-after-procedure-to-clear-infection,sports,"BOSTON — Team USA defenseman Charlie McAvoy is expected to miss multiple weeks of action for the Boston Bruins after undergoing a procedure on Tuesday to cut out and clean an infection, sources told Daily Faceoff.

McAvoy was ruled out of Thursday’s 4 Nations Face-Off winner-take-all championship game against Canada, a crushing blow to miss a potential watershed moment for hockey in the United States in a rivalry game played on home soil in his home barn.

McAvoy, 27, was hospitalized on Monday night after sources indicated he had severe pain from an infection that developed stemming from a relatively minor “upper-body” injury. The infection required urgent medical attention to stabilize the infection and stop the spread with antibiotics, followed by a procedure to scrape it out and flush it clean. The result of the procedure will keep McAvoy sidelined on a week-to-week basis until the area can heal.

McAvoy remained in a Boston hospital later on Tuesday for observation but was expected to be discharged if no further complications arose. There is no long-term concern for McAvoy’s health.

“He’s obviously disappointed that he won’t have the ability to participate in the championship game. He’s a very competitive guy, this tournament meant a lot to him,” said USA coach Mike Sullivan, who is also McAvoy’s father-in-law. “Obviously there’s a personal note with respect to my relationship with him, and I’m disappointed for him, because first and foremost he’s a great kid and he’s a terrific hockey player. And I know this meant a lot to him.”

It’s a gut punch for not only McAvoy, but also for the United States. Canada will have top defenseman Cale Makar, who missed Saturday’s game with illness, back in the lineup on Thursday night at TD Garden. McAvoy played a critical role in Team USA’s memorable win. He skated 19:27 against Canada on Saturday night and delivered two thunderous first period hits upending Connor McDavid.

Now, the United States’ blue line is in-flux, along with the NHL’s roster rules for the tournament. Sullivan said earlier Tuesday that Canucks captain Quinn Hughes was coming to Boston as a potential emergency injury replacement, but Hughes practiced in Vancouver on Tuesday and was unsure if he would make the trip.

Sources said Hughes decided he would only fly to Boston if there was a real chance he could play in Thursday’s championship. He was originally selected to the team on Dec. 4 but withdrew from the tournament due to injury and used the 12-day break in the schedule to heal.

Tournament rules indicated that players could only be added to the roster midstream if a team dipped below 12 forwards or six defensemen. That rule was originally written as position agnostic and the U.S. also has three forwards who are injured. The NHL had not yet made a ruling on Tuesday evening as to whether some of those forwards, if they were to not play, would open a hole for Hughes to join the roster and go with a lineup of 11 forwards and seven defensemen.

That seemed to be a long shot, given that would mean two forwards would have to be injured, if the NHL even allowed the swap – all of which provided pause for Hughes ahead of a cross-continent trek. Ottawa Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson was expected to remain in the lineup on Thursday to replace McAvoy.","McAvoy was ruled out of Thursday’s 4 Nations Face-Off winner-take-all championship game against Canada.

"College football's credibility at stake as Big Ten, SEC aim to tighten stranglehold on playoff access - CBS Sports",The two power leagues are seeking four automatic bids apiece as talks are scheduled to resume on Wednesday,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-footballs-credibility-at-stake-as-big-ten-sec-aim-to-tighten-stranglehold-on-playoff-access/,sports,"Even before Knute Rockne began breaking out the forward pass as a secret weapon, college football's biggest advantage was its element of surprise. Its appeal is basic and wonderful -- built on the uncertainty of the outcome.

That's because unscripted TV, in general, sells. And the unscripted TV that sells best is sports. In this age of screens and legalized betting, the games are almost DVR proof. You/me/we have to know now!

A College Football Playoff with automatic qualifiers becomes a little less unscripted -- and a little less credible, actually. Perhaps even the SEC and Big Ten athletic directors who gather this week to discuss the playoff are unaware of that basic truth.

The two conferences are in the middle of one of the biggest flexes in the game's history, basically running away and hiding with playoff access. In a repeat of an attempted takeover last year, the SEC and Big Ten this month are expected to once again try to secure four automatic qualifying spots (AQs) each beginning in 2026.

They have been warned of the risk. Maybe not directly, but any conference worth its media rights consultant knows the pitfalls. If the outcome in college football -- heck, any sport -- is known beforehand, it loses that unscripted appeal.

We're not suggesting the outcome of individual games would be known. We're definitely suggesting that a portion of the CFP field could be known in advance with AQs. With four Big Ten spots locked in, the likes of Iowa could be guaranteed a spot as early as Nov. 1 -- a month before the season ends.

Nothing against Iowa, but that stinks. More than that, it reeks of pro wrestling.

You know, the scripted TV soap opera. Sorry, Roman Reigns and John Cena, we're going there.

As popular as WWE might be, we still know the competition is fake. Outcomes are predetermined to further a storyline. Not that there's anything wrong with that because pro wrestling is a form of entertainment.

So is college football, but in a much different way. Once folks start putting a finger on the scale of parity, our hallowed sport runs the risk of turning off the public. It's one thing to have a playoff conversation about best teams vs. most deserving. It's another knowing Iowa is going to finish in the top four in the Big Ten with a month to go. That could easily be where we're headed.

The SEC and Big Ten last year actually floated an idea of their two champions being seeded No. 1 and No. 2 in the playoff. Those two spots would have been assured before the season started. At that point, why even play the season?

While there is no evidence such an outlandish demand will emerge this week, the discussion should remind us there is a ceiling on college football. The money train doesn't necessarily keep rolling down the track. There is still the possibility the big dogs could screw this up.

All any sport has is its reputation. That's why college administrators freaked out when sports betting was legalized seven years ago. All it takes is one scandal.

The CFP has prospered to this point because the teams have largely been perceived as being the right ones. There have been a few controversies (See: Florida State in 2023.) But the moment the public loses faith in the process because the Big Ten or SEC have to get that fourth team in the field, then the CFP is done.

There is evidence that all is not right. The playoff whiffed badly and stubbornly believing it could stage weeknight New Year's Eve semifinals in 2015. Those games tanked badly in the ratings. In fact, since about Year 2, the CFP championship game ratings overall have been uneven.

Since then, the game has essentially developed two new bosses: Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti and SEC counterpart Greg Sankey.

Their ADs meet together beginning Wednesday to continue discussions on what might turn out be a hostile takeover of the sport. Another attempt will be made at expanding the playoff to 14 teams, at least, according to Yahoo Sports. The AQs would go to SEC (four), Big Ten (four), ACC (two), Big 12 (two), Group of Five (one) and at-large (one).

Then, those expansive changes would have to be sold to the public outside the meeting room. Joe Six Pack will vote with their remotes. If you haven't noticed, the SEC and Big Ten not only own the CFP, but they own the sport. They get most of the money, and no matter what happens, they'll get most of the playoff berths. The rest of the bread crumbs are left for the other seven conferences.

And maybe that's the way it should be. But with all that power comes a sense of stewardship. They can't screw this up.

A Big Ten/SEC College Football Playoff takeover is inevitable, but what if it's actually the best solution? Tom Fornelli

Remember that Iowa example? At the beginning of November 2024, CBS Sports estimated that 45-50 schools were still in the running for the playoff. That assertion was backed up by the original stakeholders who actually modeled the 12-team playoff.

With eight spots already guaranteed to the two power leagues, the number of contenders has to go down. Simple math tells you that even with 14 teams, there will be less spots available.

The issue is monstrously complicated. The Power Four leagues are already so bloated their teams don't play half the others in conference action. That now takes a period of years. In Year 1 of the 12-team bracket, that produced the discourse surrounding Indiana and its strength of schedule.

That's why the stakeholders absolutely can't mess this up. The warning signs continue to flash red. The latest championship game featured two bluebloods: Notre Dame and Ohio State. It was the fifth-least watched championship game since the BCS started in 1998.

Ratings are subject to a lot of influences, big and small. The CFP will be going up against the NFL more, not less, if the league decides to expand to 18 regular-season games. Playing the championship game on a Monday night continues to be a ratings challenge. One industry source said moving the Sugar Bowl from Jan. 1 on a Wednesday night to Jan. 2 on a Thursday afternoon because of the New Orleans terrorist attack cost the ratings five million viewers.

It couldn't be helped, obviously, but what other unknowns lurk out there? Does the annual possibility of three Michigan vs. Ohio State games improve those ratings? Too much of a good thing is overkill.

And rightsholder ESPN has to make its money back some kind of way. There are already whispers the Worldwide Leader is against expansion and AQs.

All of it further guarantees disagreement in the room next week when the nine FBS conferences and Notre Dame get together for the annual CFP meetings.

""[The playoff] can't become an invitational,"" Notre Dame AD Pete Bevacqua told CBS Sports recently.

The majority of FBS conferences agree. But the SEC and Big Ten long ago wrested control of the CFP from the rank and file. Each conference gets 29% of the revenue. Do the math. That means the 100 schools and seven conferences split up the remaining 42% of the revenue.

There are reports those two leagues have weighted voting in their favor on the AQ issue. However, CBS Sports has learned there is still contractual language that requires a robust discussion on the issue among the members before any changes.

But, at the end of the day, the SEC and Big Ten could take their ball and go home -- sell their rights to the highest bidder for a playoff that only includes their 34 teams. That could come as soon as the beginning of the next decade.

Those media rights would be through the roof. And, without saying it, the SEC and Big Ten are saying it: Those two leagues don't care if those other 100 are involved. Both commissioners want more, better games. The two leagues are already talking playing each other in a series of nonconference games, which would enhance schedule strength and also playoff access.

The issue boils down to a central concern: The SEC and Big Ten don't trust the selection committee. Actually, they don't trust the selection committee to select enough of their teams. So they want guaranteed spots.

Some of that makes sense. The SEC and Big Ten do carry the sport and deserve weighted shares, influence and money. CBS Sports reported a year ago the Big Ten and SEC have combined to occupy 62% of 184 BCS/CFP slots since 1998.

Behind the inevitability of the Big Ten and SEC gaining access, revenue, power in College Football Playoff Dennis Dodd

As much as the Big 12 and ACC might be against AQs, being guaranteed two spots annually -- with a chance for more -- isn't a bad thing. ESPN doesn't have to pay extra for expansion to 14 teams. Sixteen, however, is another discussion.

But why even predetermine the field if the SEC and Big Ten are strong enough to get those spots anyway in most years? Some of the answers are becoming obvious.

With the largest conference (ever), the Big Ten needs more playoff access for its 18 teams.

If the SEC does add a long-discussed ninth league game, it probably needs expansion and AQs. Adding that ninth game would guarantee that half the league (eight teams) would suffer a loss by playing it. Expansion and AQs cushion the blow.

For now, the SEC and Big Ten are coming for their own self interests. It's no surprise that 3-4 teams in any league account for 75-80% of the viewership. The SEC and Big Ten are no exception. Except that industry standard has never been weaponized to this extent.

Never mind that Purdue, South Carolina, Vanderbilt, Rutgers and Northwestern would be included in this takeover. The value Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State, Alabama, LSU and Georgia bring are what makes it worth it.

But, someday, Alabama is going to wake up and ask, ""Why is Vandy making the same money as we are?"" Then the conferences will turn on their own and start cutting from within. That's a different discussion for another time.

For now, the SEC and Big Ten have become quite the tag team. Let's hope all of it doesn't develop into Wrestlemania.",The SEC and Big Ten are in the middle of one of the biggest flexes in the game's history. The two conferences are trying to secure four automatic qualifying spots (AQs) each beginning in 2026.
Motorsport.com ranks every 2025 F1 livery - Motorsport.com,"The 2025 F1 season has arrived, beginning with a history-making reveal of all 10 team's liveries for the year. What's the best-looking one to grace the stage? You'll have to see them all to find out.",https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/motorsportcom-ranks-every-2025-f1-livery-/10696926/,sports,"As the curtain fell on the bombastic F1 75 event at the O2 Arena in London, all 10 liveries that Formula 1’s teams will use in 2025 were revealed over the course of the night – between various musical performances and distinctly varied presentations from each team.

Everyone will have their own opinion on which (old spec) car was best dressed on the night, and the beauty of livery design is that it’s a purely subjective art. Even last year’s Alpine ‘livery’ had fans...somewhere, presumably.

Throughout the 2025 season, we’ll be continuing with our ratings for each driver after every race but, on this occasion, we’ll instead be giving our marks out of 10 for the presentations of the liveries this season.

They’ll be marked on originality, whether it’s an upgrade on last season’s paint scheme, and quite simply due to the author’s own tastes. One’s fellow writers won’t agree, and we’d be surprised if you did too – you have the opportunity to offer your own points of view in the comments.

Without further ado...

10 - Aston Martin Racing

This livery is a considerable downgrade. It’s hard to go wrong with British Racing Green, especially with Aston Martin’s modern-day icon of fluorescent yellow trim, but the black sidepods appear completely incongruous with the rest of the livery.

Is that a hint that the AMR25 will roll out in Bahrain with a little bit of a weight problem, and that the revised sidepods are going to be in naked carbon in Bahrain testing? We wait, indeed, with bated breath...

It’s hard to love the new direction for the livery, especially as Aston Martin could have played this very safe and turned up with something that still looked stellar.

9 - Red Bull Racing

The same. As usual. It's become a bit tired (and the cringe factor of the presentation) brings it down a couple of points.

Is there anything more to add? Oh, the sponsor on the rear wing is different. That’s...something.

8 - Williams

It’s blue. Very blue. I mean, it’s fine if you like blue, with a dark blue to medium blue gradient through the car. But it just feels a little bit...low effort, perhaps? The tesselating blue pattern from the previous couple of cars is gone, and the yellow engine cover tease used at the end of last season is nothing but a distant memory.

It appears the overall livery has been simplified to accentuate the rather conspicuous Atlassian logos now added to the engine cover as Williams has signed what has been touted as its biggest title partnership ever.

The Duracell battery engine cover remains, but the novelty has probably worn off.

7 - Sauber

The key issue with 2024’s livery was that it looked somewhat pedestrian; the weight-saving efforts with the nude carbon fully dampened the potential of leading with a neon green scheme.

Thankfully, this year’s effort is much more cohesive. Clearly influenced by the better reception its Las Vegas rendition got, the use of green is more liberal in the first two-thirds of the car. Then there’s a fade gradient that transitions into what appears to be naked carbon at the rear.

The car shown at the event seemed to be in a much less ennobling livery than the launch images revealed by the team in its press materials. If the actual car looks like the render images, and if that gradient actually blends well into the carbon, then it could be a hit.

6 - McLaren

McLaren MCL39 Photo by: McLaren

Team principal Andrea Stella stated that McLaren wanted continuity with its constructors’ championship winner from 2024, and it’s done that; it keeps the papaya flashes draped on top of black carbon in pretty much exactly the same arrangement as before.

For those hoping for something a little bit more from the team, then you’ll be disappointed. Ultimately isn’t a bad livery by any stretch, but it’s not a great one either; it just merely exists to maintain its post-Ron Dennis-era identity and act as a platform for its plentiful commercial partners. Could there be more orange? Yes. Could the team have played about with the form factor a little more? Yes. But hey, they like what they had – and that’s okay.

5 - Haas F1 Team

Less naked carbon, more chance for the designers to flex their creative chops — and Haas has delivered something that should stand out more than its usually conservative efforts.

A fresh spin on the white, black, and red tones that it has stuck to in the past few seasons looks good, and it’s refreshing to see the sidepods get a bit more of a brighter treatment than just a giant Haas logo splodged on the face.

Is it the standout from the batch? No, but it’s unmistakably brand loyal and represents one of the more imaginative efforts from the American squad.

4 - Ferrari

Ferrari SF-25 Photo by: Ferrari

It's red, but it appears to be a much bloodier hue – much like in 2022 - versus the shades of red used over the past couple of years. The added white on the engine cover, naturally to accentuate the HP title sponsorship, rather harks back to the Michael Schumacher days — particularly at the races when its Marlboro sponsorship was covered up by a white square.

The yellow notes are gone, which is a little bit sad. And if we’re being really picky, the UniCredit sponsorship doesn’t entirely sit well with the rest of the car; the white outlines look a little clumsy. At least the accent stripe relates to its similar World Endurance Championship livery.

I don’t hate this – actually, it’s a decent effort to wrap in HP’s corporate desires into Ferrari’s historic back catalogue of red and white efforts. But I suspect I might be in the minority.

3 - Mercedes

Same, but different. The extra silver on the engine cover and flanks is a nice touch, which upgrades the already-pretty 2024 livery. That begs the question over the scope of INEOS’ involvement with the team, as the red flash that usually surrounded its rollhoop branding is gone – as is said branding, much reduced over the revised livery that will adorn the W16.

The use of Petronas teal remains tasteful, separated from the silver by the use of black around the car, as suitable Mercedes branding continues to pepper the livery’s blanker spots.

As we said, it’s an upgrade and I’m quite fond of it. Perhaps there was more scope to be imaginative around the sidepods, which remain black with a teal flash. Otherwise, it’s a lovely livery.

2 - Alpine

Alpine A525 Photo by: Alpine

That’s more like it! After last year’s woeful effort as it eschewed paintwork in line with its overweight chassis, Alpine at least started to add a little bit more paint back onto the car towards the end of 2024. This time, it’s back with a bang – and for followers of F1 esoterica, with a paint job similar to Brabham’s 1992 BT60B.

The pink nose wouldn’t flawlessly merge with the metallic blue, so the carbon black has been kept sparingly to create space between the two. To see Alpine’s ‘proper’ brand colours back in F1 is a welcome sight, and the team has been bold with its inventive contrast between colours. In other words, it’s anathema to last year’s carbon-heavy liveries.

Further notes: the team has opened its livery space on the engine cover to new fuel partner Eni, which returns to F1 for the first time (when it was Agip) since 2000. You’ll see the pink and blue machines from a mile away – which is what a distinctive livery is all about. Quite the turnaround – chapeau, Alpine.

1 - Racing Bulls (VCARB)

Racing Bulls VCARB 02 Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool

“White like Turkey teeth,” said comedian Munya Chawawa, who was brought in to present the team’s new identity. And... it’s very white, but with the clearest Red Bull iconography that the team has used since its days as Toro Rosso.

There's the yellow nose cap and roll hoop, flanked by the scarlet hues of the energy drink brand’s bull logo. The white backdrop is likely all the better for the myriad sponsors involved, which no longer have to rely on the clumsy white blocks of colour hurled onto the metallic blue tones that RB used last year.

There’s at least a little bit of blue on the car, albeit at the rear as it progresses into an MC Escher-esque transition from a dark blue to white with the use of further Red Bull logos.

Think Red Bull’s revered 2020 Turkey one-off livery, but perhaps a little more cluttered. It’s still pretty nice, though.

Source: Giroud's L.A. home robbed in $500K heist - ESPN,"LAFC striker Olivier Giroud lost approximately $500,000 worth of jewelry when his Los Angeles home was burglarized earlier this month, a source told ESPN.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/43909762/lafc-striker-giroud-home-robbed-500k-heist,sports,"Open Extended Reactions

LAFC striker Olivier Giroud lost approximately $500,000 worth of jewelry when his Los Angeles home was burglarized earlier this month, a source told ESPN.

The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed on Tuesday they had responded Feb. 5 to a report of a window smash at a home in west L.A. The caller, who the source said was Giroud's wife Jennifer, reported an upstairs bedroom window broken and their home burglarized.

The LAFC forward and his family were not at the property when burglars broke in and stole jewelry and other items -- including 10 luxury watches -- belonging to the 2018 World Cup winner.

LAFC spokesperson Seth Burton declined to comment on behalf of Giroud and the organization beyond confirming the burglary report.

The 38-year-old former Chelsea and Arsenal star is in the final stages of preparation with LAFC for the upcoming MLS season, with his team kicking off against Minnesota United at home Saturday.

On Tuesday night, Giroud started for LAFC in their 2-1 loss against the Colorado Rapids in the first leg of Round 1 of the Concacaf Champions Cup.

Giroud has not scored in 14 games for LAFC since his move from AC Milan to MLS last summer.

He is the latest high-profile athlete to be the victim of such an incident after the likes of NFL stars Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Joe Burrow had their homes burglarized in recent months.

The L.A. police have not made any arrests associated with the burglary and are continuing to investigate the matter.

Giroud is best known for his six prolific seasons at Arsenal from 2012-18, followed by three years apiece at Chelsea and Milan. He has scored 285 goals in 716 matches during his club career while winning a wealth of trophies, including a Champions League triumph with Chelsea three years ago.

He was also a star for the France national team, scoring a record 57 goals and playing for Les Bleus' World Cup winners in 2018.

Information from The Associated Press was used in this story.","LAFC striker Olivier Giroud's home was burglarized earlier this month, a source says.

Cubs To Sign Justin Turner - MLB Trade Rumors,The Chicago Cubs have reached an agreement with free agent Justin Turner.,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/02/cubs-close-to-signing-justin-turner.html,sports,"Feb. 19: Turner has reported to camp and is prepping for his first workout with the team, per Bruce Levine of 670 The Score. The Cubs still haven’t formally announced the signing, but his presence in camp surely means an announcement and corresponding 40-man move are imminent.

Unsurprisingly, he’ll work primarily as a first baseman and as a designated hitter, per Patrick Mooney of The Athletic. Turner only has 90 innings at third base over the past two seasons, so logging any kind of regular action there was never likely. He could get an occasional spot start, but the likelier role will be to spell Busch once or twice per week, spell Suzuki on occasion, and step in as DH when Suzuki is filling in at the outfield corners.

Feb. 18: The Cubs are reportedly in agreement with 40-year-old free agent Justin Turner on a one-year, $6MM deal. The signing, which is still pending a physical, includes another $2.5MM in performance bonuses for the Vayner Sports client. Chicago will need to make a 40-man roster move once the deal is finalized.

Despite his age, Turner remained a productive bat for the Blue Jays and Mariners in 2024. He hit 24 doubles and 11 home runs while continuing to make the most of his plate discipline and contact skills en route to a .737 OPS and 117 wRC+. The righty batter was particularly productive for Seattle in September, slashing .295/.396/.449 with a 143 wRC+. In other words, there is little reason to doubt that he can still be a valuable contributor to a team with postseason aspirations.

Turner has qualified for the batting title in each of the past four seasons, but he will take on more of a part-time role with the Cubs. ESPN’s Jesse Rogers notes that Turner is expected to fill a backup role at first and third base. Chicago reportedly considered many options for such a job but ultimately settled on Turner after missing out on star third baseman Alex Bregman (per Rogers). The Cubs were a finalist to sign Bregman before he joined the Red Sox instead. The team also reportedly considered trading for Nolan Arenado, although it comes as no surprise that the Cardinals weren’t interested in trading Arenado to a division rival (per Mooney).

Primarily a third baseman in his younger days, Turner has only played a handful of games at the hot corner in each of the past two seasons. Instead, he has transitioned to a first base/DH role. However, both of those jobs are already spoken for in Chicago, with the promising sophomore Michael Busch at first base and Seiya Suzuki, arguably the team’s second-best hitter after Kyle Tucker, penciled in at DH.

So, Turner is likely to get his playing time as a backup option at multiple positions and a bat off the bench. He could also platoon with Busch at first if the lefty batter continues to struggle against same-handed pitching. On top of that, Turner will offer the club insurance in the case of an injury to Busch, Suzuki, or a corner outfielder; if Tucker or Ian Happ gets hurt, Suzuki could play the outfield with Turner taking over as the primary DH.

In addition, Turner will provide a bit more stability at third base, which is currently something of a question mark for the Cubs. Top prospect Matt Shaw seems to be the most likely choice to win the third base gig out of camp, but the 23-year-old has yet to play a game at the big league level. Thus, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer made it clear that Shaw is not yet guaranteed the starting job. However, the Cubs don’t exactly have a ton of other options. Jon Berti and Vidal Brujan both have MLB experience at third, but neither is a starting-caliber player at the position. Meanwhile, Rule 5 pick Gage Workman is himself an unknown quantity; he has not played a game above Double-A. The 40-year-old Turner isn’t necessarily a solution, but he will, at least, improve the team’s depth at third. His glove might be a liability, but if nothing else, he’s a talented hitter who knows how to play the position.

Patrick Mooney of The Athletic was first to report that the Cubs and Turner were finalizing a one-year, $6MM deal. Jon Heyman of The New York Post confirmed there was an agreement in place and reported the $2.5MM in performance bonuses.",Justin Turner has reported to camp with the Cubs.

The Real Madrid starting lineup that has a 99% chance of beating Manchester City - AS USA,Antonio Rüdiger is fit to return for the Champions League knockout phase playoff game and will renew his titanic battle with Erling Haaland.,https://en.as.com/soccer/the-real-madrid-starting-lineup-that-has-a-99-chance-of-beating-manchester-city-n/,sports,"Real Madrid have been handed a huge boost ahead of the Champions League knockout phase playoff second leg against Manchester City by the return to action of Antonio Rüdiger, who will renew his battle with Erling Haaland.

Madrid will, of course, line up with their “Fantastic Four” (Bellingham, Rodrygo, Mbappé, Vinicius) in attack. The only likely “surprise” in Carlo Ancelotti’s team is Fede Valverde at right-back, although that hardly comes out of the blue.

Even the Uruguayan himself is getting more comfortable in the role: “I think I’ve done pretty well when I’ve had to play there. I try to contribute, give my all, get forward, defend… If I don’t get many chances in midfield in the future, I’m sure I’ll be a right-back.”

Guardiola: “City have a 1% chance of beating Real Madrid”

City coach Pep Guardiola made headlines before the game by claiming his team only has a 1% chance of progressing to the round of 16. Ancelotti, though, isn’t falling into his counterpart’s trap. “He doesn’t really think that, I’ll ask him before the game.”

Against City, the Italian will use the strongest possible weapons he has at his disposal.

Real Madrid attack guarantees goals

Starting in attack, with Bellingham, Rodrygo, Mbappé and Vinicius ready to fire Madrid into the next round. Between them, the quartet has scored 66 of Los Blancos' 98 goals this season and the Spaniards will almost certainly progress to the next round if they are anywhere near top form.

With Valverde needed at right-back and Rüdiger returning in central defence, a space has opened up again in midfield for Aurélien Tchouaméni.

The Frenchman has been criticized by many, but is indispensable for Ancelotti. Although Camavinga is also in with a chance of starting, Tchouaméni’s defensive instincts and positional sense put him in pole position.

His partner, no matter how well Luka Modric might be playing, will be Dani Ceballos. The former Betis star has earned his place in the big games with recent performances. His passing accuracy has resembled that of Toni Kroos, exceeding 95% from over 100 passes per game. The 28-year-old has gained Ancelotti’s trust.

Possible Real Madrid XI to play Manchester City

Of those not already mentioned, Thibaut Courtois will take up his usual spot in goal. Rüdiger is expected to be joined in central defence by Raúl Asencio, with Ferland Mendy and Fran García continuing their ongoing battle to be named at left-back. The Frenchman may get the nod for his experience.

The lineup Ancelotti has in mind to face City is: Courtois; Valverde, Asencio, Rüdiger, Mendy; Tchouameni, Ceballos; Rodrygo, Bellingham, Vinicius; Mbappé.

"Saints Hire Scott Tolzien, T.J. Paganetti; ‘Zeroing In’ On Doug Nussmeier As OC - profootballrumors.com",The Eagles are continuing to fill out the staff of new head coach Kellen Moore.,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/02/saints-hire-scott-tolzien-t-j-paganetti-zeroing-in-on-doug-nussmeier-as-oc,sports,"Like many coordinators who get head coaching opportunities, Kellen Moore is bringing multiple members of his staff in Philadelphia to his new job in New Orleans.

The Saints “are currently working to finalize a deal” to make Doug Nussmeier their next offensive coordinator, per veteran NFL insider Josina Anderson. Nussmeier spent 2024 as the Eagles’ quarterbacks coach and is considered the frontrunner for the job position in New Orleans. He previously coached quarterbacks for the Chargers and the Cowboys. Nussmeier also served as offensive coordinator for several major college programs from 2008 to 2017, including Alabama, Florida, and Michigan.

Nussmeier isn’t the only top Eagles assistant following Moore to New Orleans. The Saints are also hiring Eagles run game specialist and assistant offensive line coach T.J. Paganetti, per Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football. He has spent the last eight seasons in Philadelphia, working closely with legendary Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland. Paganetti will likely take over as the Saints’ offensive line coach after John Benton followed Klint Kubiak to Seattle.

Moore is hiring another familiar face to serve as quarterbacks coach in Scott Tolzien, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. Tolzien was an assistant in Dallas when Moore was the Cowboys’ offensive coordinator from 2020 to 2022. Tolzien was promoted to quarterbacks coach after Moore moved on in 2023, but was not expected to be retained on Brian Schottenheimer‘s new staff.

Tolzien, a former NFL quarterback himself, will help the Saints navigate an uncertain quarterback situation this year. Derek Carr performed well in 2024, but struggled to stay healthy. His durability will remain a concern entering his age-34 season – if he even stays on the roster – but neither Spencer Rattler nor Jake Haener inspired much confidence in 2024. The Saints’ cap situation will hinder them in the free agent quarterback market, and the draft’s top quarterbacks will likely go before their first round pick (No. 9 overall).",Doug Nussmeier and T.J.

Diagnostic dilemma: Weakness in a man's leg revealed his abnormally small brain - Livescience.com,"A man went to hospital complaining about weakness in his left leg, and subsequent brain scans revealed a surprising finding.",https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-weakness-in-a-mans-leg-revealed-his-abnormally-small-brain,health,"Brain scans revealed a notable buildup of fluid in a man's brain that had pushed its tissues up against the skull.

The patient: A 44-year-old man in France

The symptoms: For two weeks prior to going to the doctor, the man had been feeling mild weakness in his left leg. There weren't any notable abnormalities in his medical history or neurological development, except for when a shunt had to be placed in his head when he was 6 months old. The shunt helped relieve fluid buildup in his brain, which had an unknown cause. When he turned 14 years old, the shunt was removed.

What happened next: When the man reported his leg weakness to medical practitioners, doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head. They also performed neuropsychological testing, which revealed that the man's IQ was 75, below the average score of 100.

The diagnosis: Doctors determined that the patient was living with a brain that was at least half the average size.

The brain scans also revealed a large buildup of fluid in his brain, which allowed little room for tissue. This left the patient with just a thin sheet of brain tissue pushed up against his skull. The scans showed that the fluid-filled cavities in the brain — called ventricles — were extremely dilated. It's likely that this fluid accumulation drove the man's leg weakness.

The treatment: Doctors drained this excess fluid from the man's skull, which helped the patient regain some of his leg strength. In a case report published in The Lancet , the doctors wrote that a new shunt was also inserted inside the man's skull, and within a few weeks, the patient's neurological examinations — which were used to evaluate his leg weakness — returned to baseline. ""The findings on neuropsychological testing and CT did not change,"" they noted, so the man's IQ remained about the same.

What makes the case unique: Over the course of evolutionary history, humans' brains became notably large compared with those of our relatives, leading to improved cognitive capacity and language acquisition. The exact reasons for this growth are not fully understood but are likely linked to a combination of environmental and dietary factors, among other pressures.

A human's brain also grows significantly within a person's lifetime, with the brain during adulthood typically being dramatically larger than the size of their brain as a newborn. In the man's case, it might have been expected that he would show deficits due to having a smaller-than-average brain. However, despite the smaller size of his brain, the man did not show any deficits and was working as a civil servant.

Had he not developed leg weakness, his small brain may well have gone unnoticed.","A 44-year-old man in France had been feeling mild weakness in his left leg. Doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head and found a buildup of fluid in his brain that had pushed its tissues up against the skull. The man's IQ was 75, below the average score of 100."
Here’s What You Should Know If You Drink Ginger Ale To Settle Your Stomach - BuzzFeed,Sorry to burst your bubble.,https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelseyborresen/does-ginger-ale-actually-help-upset-stomach-sc,health,"But it’s important to note that these benefits are specifically associated with actual ginger root — not just the ginger flavoring found in many sodas.

“Most commercial ginger ale contains very little to no actual ginger,” Sassos said.

In recent years, false advertising lawsuits have been filed against the company that makes Canada Dry ginger ale in the U.S. and Canada over claims that the product is “made from real ginger,” as it states on the packaging.

These claims “deceive and mislead reasonable customers into believing that [Canada Dry is] made using ginger root — i.e. the spice made by chopping or powdering the root of the ginger plant — and not minuscule amounts of flavoring ‘extracts,’” one of the lawsuits alleged, as reported by the National Post.

The class action suits in both countries have since been settled. As part of the U.S. settlement, the company agreed to remove the words “made from real ginger” from its marketing in the future. However, the product is still marketed this way in Canada.

Ginger ale could actually do more harm than good.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lukasz Kwapisz, of Gastro Health in Miami, explained that the high sugar content in ginger ale and other sodas — usually upward of 30 grams per serving — can actually make stomach troubles worse.

“Too much sugar could trigger inflammation and may increase bloating and gas, which could further irritate an upset stomach,” he told HuffPost.

What about diet ginger ale? Sassos doesn’t recommend it for an upset stomach, because the sugar alcohols used to sweeten some of these products “may only further exacerbate symptoms.”

For some people, the carbonation in ginger ale and other fizzy beverages may help ease their gastrointestinal distress, Sassos said, while other people may find that it makes things worse. So it really depends on how your body responds.

Registered dietitian Maya Feller of Maya Feller Nutrition in Brooklyn, New York, pointed out that even though it has the word “ginger” in its name, ginger ale is not a “health food beverage.”

“If you’re looking for a therapeutic property from it, it might most likely be placebo,” Feller said. “And that’s fine, because you’re feeling better, right? At the end of the day, it is soda. And so I would encourage folks to interact with this the way that they would interact with soda.”

What to try instead","False advertising lawsuits have been filed against the company that makes Canada Dry. The class action suits in both countries have since been settled.

3 more Portland-area cats test positive for bird flu as infections spread - OregonLive,At least four Oregon cats have been euthanized in the past two months after developing severe symptoms from bird flu.,https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/02/3-more-portland-area-cats-test-positive-for-bird-flu-as-infections-spread.html,health,"Three cats from a single Clackamas County household tested positive for bird flu this week, marking the latest infections across Oregon in the past two months, state officials confirmed Tuesday.

Seven cats in the Portland area have now contracted avian influenza since December, including two others in Washington County and two in Multnomah County. At least four of those cats have been euthanized after developing severe symptoms, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

Most of the infected cats contracted bird flu from raw pet food, according to Ryan Scholz, state veterinarian at the state agency. The disease is more common among poultry, but can spread to other animals through direct contact with infected birds or by consuming infected raw meat or milk.

A spokesperson for the state agency did not confirm whether the three Clackamas County cats had consumed raw pet food prior to their infections.

Bird flu can lead to severe and fatal symptoms. Typical signs of bird flu are fever, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite and eye or nasal discharge. Dogs can also contract the disease but are less susceptible, according to the state agency.

DoveLewis veterinary hospital in Portland said Tuesday it had treated two cats that tested positive for bird flu. One had to be put down, and the other recovered, a spokesperson for the hospital said in a press release. It’s not clear whether these cats are included among the state’s confirmed cases.

Scholz said he expects the number of infections in cats to continue rising. The state agency has ramped up its testing efforts to learn more about the disease’s effects on different animals, Scholz said.

“We are testing a lot of animals,” Scholz said. “We haven’t had any cases in dogs, but it’s certainly possible, and so we’re trying to cast a fairly broad net right now.”

The state agency recommends not feeding pets raw meat or milk. It also advises keeping pets away from wild birds or poultry and washing hands after handling raw meat or interacting with poultry or dead animals.

The Washington State Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert notifying people of the risk related to products of Wild Coast Raw, an Olympia, Washington-based company. At least two of the bird flu infections in Oregon were tied to this product, officials said.

Prior to the recent wave of infections in cats, Oregon had only two recorded cases of bird flu infecting cats. Both cases occurred in Linn County in 2022, according to agency spokesperson Andrea Cantu-Schomus.

In rare cases, humans can also contract bird flu. However, there have been no reported human infections in Oregon following contact with an infected cat, the agency said.

Want better focus and a happier mind? This simple smartphone change could be the answer - PsyPost,"Feeling overwhelmed and distracted? New research reveals a potential solution: block mobile internet on your phone. The findings suggest it can boost your mood, sharpen focus, and improve mental well-being.",https://www.psypost.org/want-better-focus-and-a-happier-mind-this-simple-smartphone-change-could-be-the-answer/,health,"Spending hours each day connected to the internet through our smartphones has become the norm for many. However, new research indicates that taking a break from this constant online access can lead to noticeable improvements in mental health, overall happiness, and the ability to focus. A study published in PNAS Nexus found that when people blocked mobile internet on their smartphones for just two weeks, they experienced better mental well-being, felt happier, and showed improved attention spans.

The motivation behind this research stems from growing concerns about the potential negative effects of smartphone use on our minds and emotions. Smartphones offer unparalleled convenience, putting a wealth of information, entertainment, and social connections at our fingertips at all times. While these devices offer many advantages, there is a rising tide of public worry that constant smartphone use might be harming our cognitive abilities and emotional state.

Surveys reveal that a significant portion of smartphone users are concerned about using their devices too much. Specifically, a 2022 poll showed that nearly 60% of American smartphone users, and an even higher 80% of those under 30, feel they over-rely on their phones. These widespread worries are echoed in popular commentary, with some observers suggesting smartphones are “hijacking our minds” and negatively impacting an entire generation.

Supporting these concerns, previous studies that examined the relationship between smartphone use and well-being have found links between heavier smartphone use and poorer subjective well-being, increased mental health issues, and reduced attentional capabilities. However, much of this prior research has been correlational, meaning it can show that two things are related but not necessarily that one causes the other. To address this gap, researchers wanted to investigate whether limiting access to mobile internet on smartphones would directly cause improvements in these areas. They designed a study to specifically target the feature that makes smartphones so powerful – their ability to connect to the internet from almost anywhere.

The researchers aimed to provide solid, experimental evidence to answer a question relevant in our increasingly digital world: if we were not constantly connected to the internet via our phones, would our minds and emotional well-being benefit?

“Smartphones have drastically changed our lives and behaviors over the past 15 years, but our basic human psychology remains the same,” explained study author Adrian Ward, associate professor of marketing at the University of Texas at Austin. “Our big question was, are we adapted to deal with constant connection to everything all the time? The data suggest that we are not.”

To explore this question, the researchers conducted a month-long study involving 467 participants from the United States and Canada. Participants were recruited online through a platform called Prolific. To participate, individuals had to be iPhone users because the application used to block internet access was only compatible with iPhones. The average age of the participants was 32 years old, and 63% were women. The group represented a range of educational backgrounds and ethnic identities, and included students, individuals employed full-time and part-time, and others.

The study employed a randomized controlled trial design, which is a strong method for determining cause and effect. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Intervention group and the Delayed Intervention group. Both groups used their smartphones as normal at the beginning of the study. Then, for the first two weeks, the Intervention group had their mobile internet access blocked, while the Delayed Intervention group continued to use their phones without restrictions.

For the following two weeks, the roles reversed: the Intervention group regained full mobile internet access, and the Delayed Intervention group had their mobile internet blocked. This “cross-over” design allowed researchers to compare the effects of blocking internet access against a baseline of normal use within the same individuals, and also to see if any positive effects persisted after internet access was restored.

To block mobile internet access, participants in the intervention phases were instructed to install a smartphone application called Freedom. This application was set up to block all mobile internet access, including both Wi-Fi and cellular data, on their smartphones for two weeks. Importantly, the block specifically targeted internet access, while allowing participants to continue using their phones for text messages and phone calls. They could also still access the internet through other devices like desktop computers or laptops. This design allowed the researchers to isolate the impact of mobile internet access specifically, rather than completely disconnecting participants from all digital technologies.

A key aspect of this study was the objective tracking of whether participants actually adhered to the internet block. The Freedom application automatically recorded whether the internet block was active throughout the intervention period, providing a measure of compliance. Participants completed surveys and cognitive tests at three points in time: at the beginning of the study (baseline), after the first two weeks, and after four weeks. These assessments measured subjective well-being, mental health, and attention.

Subjective well-being was measured using a standard model that includes three components: positive emotions, negative emotions, and satisfaction with life. Mental health was assessed using a range of measures designed to identify symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger, social anxiety, and difficulties in personality functioning. Attention was evaluated in two ways: through a self-report questionnaire that asked about attentional lapses and mind-wandering, and through an objective computer task called the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). The gradCPT is designed to measure sustained attention – the ability to maintain focus over time – by requiring participants to respond to certain images while withholding responses to others.

In addition to these main outcomes, the researchers also measured several factors that might explain why blocking mobile internet could lead to improvements. These potential mediating factors included social connectedness, feelings of self-control, how participants spent their time (categorized as time in the offline world, time on digital communication, and time consuming media), and sleep duration. Finally, they also assessed baseline levels of “Fear of Missing Out” (FoMO) and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to see if these factors influenced how much people benefited from the internet block.

The study found that blocking mobile internet access for two weeks had a positive impact on several aspects of psychological functioning. Participants in the Intervention group showed significant improvements in subjective well-being and mental health during the first two weeks when their internet was blocked. These improvements were observed as increases in positive emotions and life satisfaction, and decreases in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. Similarly, when the Delayed Intervention group had their internet blocked in the second two weeks, they also experienced comparable improvements in well-being and mental health.

Regarding attention, both groups showed improvements in their ability to sustain attention, as measured by the objective gradCPT task, during their respective internet blocking periods. Participants also reported fewer attentional lapses and improved attentional awareness when mobile internet was restricted. Interestingly, for both well-being and mental health, the positive effects appeared to lessen somewhat after the internet block was removed, although well-being remained significantly higher than at the start of the study. However, for attentional awareness, the improvements seemed to persist even after mobile internet access was restored.

To understand the reasons behind these positive changes, the researchers examined the potential mediating factors. They found that the improvements in well-being, mental health, and attentional awareness could be partially explained by shifts in how people spent their time when they did not have mobile internet access. Specifically, during the internet block, participants reported spending more time engaging in offline activities such as socializing in person, exercising, and being in nature. They also spent less time consuming media. These changes in time use, along with increases in feelings of social connectedness and self-control, and even slightly improved sleep, appeared to contribute to the observed benefits of blocking mobile internet.

Furthermore, the study explored whether certain individual characteristics influenced the effectiveness of the internet block. They found that individuals who reported higher levels of Fear of Missing Out at the start of the study experienced greater improvements in both subjective well-being and mental health when they blocked mobile internet. Similarly, those with more ADHD symptoms at the beginning of the study showed larger improvements in attentional awareness when their mobile internet was restricted. This suggests that people who are more prone to worrying about missing out online or who struggle with attention may benefit even more from taking breaks from constant mobile internet access.

While the study provides valuable insights, it is important to consider its limitations. One limitation is that only about 25% of participants fully complied with the internet block throughout the entire two-week intervention period, based on a strict definition of compliance. However, even with this imperfect compliance, the researchers still observed significant positive effects, suggesting that even partial reductions in mobile internet use can be beneficial. Another limitation is that the study focused specifically on iPhone users, so it is not yet clear if the findings would generalize to users of other types of smartphones.

Future research could build upon these findings by investigating the long-term effects of mobile internet restriction. It would also be valuable to explore these effects in different populations and to examine the optimal duration and strategies for internet restriction to maximize benefits. Further research could also investigate how different types of online content and activities contribute to the observed effects. Finally, a more in-depth examination of the specific mechanisms through which reduced mobile internet use leads to improvements in well-being and attention would further enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between our digital habits and our psychological health.

"As egg prices soar, Trump administration plans new strategy to fight bird flu - The Associated Press","With egg prices soaring, the Trump administration is planning a new strategy for fighting bird flu that stresses vaccinations and tighter biosecurity instead of killing off millions of chickens when the disease strikes a flock. The director of the National Ec…",https://apnews.com/article/trump-administration-egg-prices-shortage-bird-flu-9a0dac14ed29ecacd7f0f913d602c3aa,health,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — With egg prices soaring, the Trump administration is planning a new strategy for fighting bird flu that stresses vaccinations and tighter biosecurity instead of killing off millions of chickens when the disease strikes a flock.

The federal government will seek “better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on” rather than the current standard practice of destroying all the birds on a farm when an infection is detected, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”

Hasset said the administration planned to announce further details this week. He said they were “working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world,” to get the plan ready.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to messages Tuesday seeking more information.

Normally when chickens or turkeys start dying from the disease, officials will “depopulate,” or destroy all the birds on the farm to prevent it from spreading.

But the resulting culling of millions of chickens per month has caused egg prices to skyrocket, with shortages that have led some retailers to ration sales. The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities hit $4.95 in January, and the USDA predicts it will soar another 20% this year.

Hassett didn’t provide many details of how the Trump administration’s new approach would work. But he said it would involve a “better, smarter perimeter” around poultry farms. He said it doesn’t make sense to kill all the chickens inside that perimeter when the disease is being spread by wild ducks and geese.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told “Fox and Friends” that her first briefing after being sworn in was on bird flu.

“We are looking at every possible scenario to ensure that we are doing everything we can in a safe, secure manner but also to ensure that Americans have the food that they need,” Rollins told Fox News.

The poultry industry has long resisted vaccinating flocks against bird flu because of the potential impacts on export markets, as well as the expense. Most U.S. trading partners won’t accept exports from countries that allow vaccinations due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the virus.

“We support the administration and their goals to bring down food inflation and cut regulatory red tape and hopefully eliminate this virus,” said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, which represents the broiler industry which produces chickens for meat. But he said in an interview that producers need ”robust trade protection” to ensure they don’t lose markets.

Leaders of the Congressional Chicken Caucus said in a letter to Rollins last week that while the egg industry has lost the most birds, the broiler industry could bear a disproportionate share of the costs of any policy change. According to USDA figures 77.5% of the nearly 159 million commercial birds lost to avian influenza since February 2022 have been layers, or over 123 million. That compares to 13.7 million broilers, or 8.6%, and 18.7 million turkeys, or 11.8%.

Avian influenza vaccines have long been available. Animal health company Zoetis announced on Friday that it had received a conditional license from the USDA for a new vaccine. But using it would be up to federal authorities in partnership with the industry, the company said in a statement. Other manufacturers are also working on them.

Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota, said tighter biosecurity to prevent cross-contamination and limit outbreaks to one barn “requires an incredible amount of work on the ground,” she said.

‘I’ve seen it work,” Cardona said in an interview. “I’ve seen it fail dramatically in other cases.”

For “precision depopulation” to work, she said, there must be effective barriers to transmission between barns, such as ensuring that farm workers don’t carry the virus on their boots or clothes. And workers need to be alert for the earliest signs of abnormal deaths, she added.

Another barrier is the logistical difficulty in giving shots to up to 3 million birds or more at a single egg farm. Current vaccines are all injectables. Farms might opt to limit them to new pullets coming onto a farm, she said.

Vaccines that could be economically administered through a farm’s water supply would require new innovations, Cardona said. But until there’s a market for vaccines, she said, there won’t be an incentive to develop them.

“Today’s technology isn’t where were going to be for long, but it’s where we’re at,” Cardona said.","Normally when chickens or turkeys start dying from the disease, officials will “depopulate,” or destroy all the birds. The new strategy stresses vaccinations and tighter biosecurity."
Why We Keep Exploring Even After Learning the Best Strategy - Neuroscience News,A new study reveals that both humans and marmosets continue to adjust their behavior even after learning an optimal task strategy.,https://neurosciencenews.com/exploration-learning-neuroscience-24831/,health,"Summary: A new study reveals that both humans and marmosets continue to adjust their behavior even after learning an optimal task strategy. Instead of sticking to a known successful approach, they subtly modify their responses based on their most recent experience. This ongoing exploration may help them adapt to changing environments or discover better strategies over time.

Researchers found that subjects predicted event timing using a hazard model but still adjusted based on prior trials. The findings suggest that exploration is an inherent strategy in decision-making, even when it leads to unnecessary errors. The study also supports the use of marmosets as models for autism research by confirming their similarity to human cognitive processes.

Maybe it’s a life hack or a liability, or a little of both.

A surprising result in a new MIT study may suggest that people and animals alike share an inherent propensity to keep updating their approach to a task even when they have already learned how they should approach it and even if the deviations sometimes lead to unnecessary error.

The behavior of “exploring” when one could just be “exploiting,” could make sense for at least two reasons, said Mriganka Sur, senior author of the study published Feb. 18 in Current Biology.

Mathematical modeling of the reaction time data revealed that both the humans and marmosets were letting the results of the immediate previous trial influence what they did on the next trial, even though they had already learned what to do. Credit: Neuroscience News

Just because a task’s rules seem set one moment doesn’t mean they’ll stay that way in this uncertain world, so altering behavior from the optimal condition every so often could help reveal needed adjustments.

Moreover, trying new things when you already know what you like is a way of finding out whether there might be something even better out there than the good thing you’ve got going on right now.

“If the goal is to maximize reward, you should never deviate once you have found the perfect solution, yet you keep exploring,” said Sur, Paul and Lilah Newton Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

“Why? It’s like food. We all like certain foods, but we still keep trying different foods because you never know, there might be something you could discover.”

Predicting timing

Former research technician Tudor Dragoi, now a graduate student at Boston University, led the study in which he and fellow members of the Sur Lab explored how humans and marmosets, a small primate, make predictions about event timing.

Three humans and two marmosets were given a simple task. They’d see an image on a screen for some amount of time—the amount of time varied from one trial to the next within a limited range—and they simply had to hit a button (marmosets poked a tablet while humans clicked a mouse) when the image disappeared.

Success was defined as reacting as quickly as possible to the image’s disappearance without hitting the button too soon. Marmosets received a juice reward on successful trials.

Though marmosets needed more training time than humans, the subjects all settled into the same reasonable pattern of behavior regarding the task. The longer the image stayed on the screen, the faster their reaction time to its disappearance.

This behavior follows the “hazard model” of prediction in which, if the image can only last for so long, the longer it’s still there, the more likely it must be to disappear very soon. The subjects learned this and overall, with more experience, their reaction times became faster.

But as the experiment continued, Sur and Dragoi’s team noticed something surprising was also going on. Mathematical modeling of the reaction time data revealed that both the humans and marmosets were letting the results of the immediate previous trial influence what they did on the next trial, even though they had already learned what to do.

If the image was only on the screen briefly in one trial, on the next round subjects would decrease reaction time a bit (presumably expecting a shorter image duration again) whereas if the image lingered, they’d increase reaction time (presumably because they figured they’d have a longer wait).

Those results add to ones from a similar study Sur’s lab published in 2023 in which they found that even after mice learned the rules of a different cognitive task, they’d arbitrarily deviate from the winning strategy every so often.

In that study, like this one, learning the successful strategy didn’t prevent subjects from continuing to test alternatives, even if it meant sacrificing reward.

“The persistence of behavioral changes even after task learning may reflect exploration as a strategy for seeking and setting on an optimal internal model of the environment,” the scientists wrote in the new study.

Relevance for autism

The similarity of the human and marmoset behaviors is an important finding as well, Sur said. That’s because differences in making predictions about one’s environment is posited to be a salient characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.

Because marmosets are small, are inherently social, and are more cognitively advanced than mice, work has begun in some labs to establish marmoset autism models, but a key component was establishing that they model autism-related behaviors well.

By demonstrating that marmosets model neurotypical human behavior regarding predictions, the study therefore adds weight to the emerging idea that marmosets can indeed provide informative models for autism studies.

In addition to Dragoi and Sur, other authors of the paper are Hiroki Sugihara, Nhat Le, Elie Adam, Jitendra Sharma, Guoping Feng and Robert Desimone.

“Global to local influences on temporal expectation in marmosets and humans” by Mriganka Sur et al. Current Biology

Abstract

Global to local influences on temporal expectation in marmosets and humans

Marmosets are emerging rapidly as experimental models for studying the neural bases of cognition and, importantly, for modeling disorders of human cognition, but many aspects of their mental attributes remain to be characterized.

When judging elapsed time, humans implicitly use prior information to predict upcoming events and reduce perceptual and decision-making uncertainty. An influential model of temporal expectation is the hazard rate model, which posits the likelihood of an event occurring in the future, provided it has not occurred already.

Here, we report that marmosets trained on a reaction time task acquire the hazard rate model of expectation, consistent with the global task structure.

The model emerges progressively with learning but unexpectedly continues to be modified by local contingencies, as demonstrated by a serial effect of trial duration on responses.

The combined effects of global and local task structure are well described by a multiple regression model and computationally by Bayesian updating of the hazard function.

Parallel experiments in human subjects similarly demonstrate global followed by local influences on reaction times and temporal expectation.

Thus, in both marmosets and humans, task history and local structure continuously update task-specific responses, surprisingly at the expense of optimal responses after the competent acquisition of an internal model.",Researchers found that subjects predicted event timing using a hazard model but still adjusted based on prior trials. The findings suggest that exploration is an inherent strategy in decision-making. The study also supports the use of marmosets as models for autism research by confirming their similarity to human cognitive processes.

Three more infections were confirmed in Gaines County, which has been the epicenter and now has 45 cases. Six more measles cases were reported in neighboring Terry County. And Lubbock County has its first case. Cases have now been detected in five Texas counties, all in the same region in west-central Texas near the border with New Mexico.

The number of patients hospitalized remained at 13. Four patients were vaccinated, and the remaining patients were unvaccinated or their status is unknown. Roughly half of the cases involve school-age children.

""Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities,"" the TDSHS said.

Probe continues in neighboring New Mexico county

Earlier this week, the New Mexico Department of Health declared a measles outbreak in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. Officials said ties to the Texas outbreak are suspected but haven't been confirmed.

Health department in other states are closely monitoring developments in Texas and have urged parents to ensure that their children are up to date with measles vaccine doses. In a press release today, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) warned of an uptick in cases in several states, including Texas and Georgia, and noted how contagious the virus is: Infected people can spread measles for as long as 3 weeks.

Karen Landers, MD, ADPH chief medical officer, said, ""One of the main messages we want to emphasize is that measles follows a pattern in which the child first develops fever, cough, runny nose, and watery/red eyes, then a rash develops. Persons can start spreading the virus up to four days before symptoms appear, and those with weak immune systems can spread the measles virus longer.""","10 more measles cases reported in Texas, bringing total to 58 since early February. Gaines County has been epicenter, with 45 cases. Roughly half of the cases involve school-age children."
"7-Day Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for Healthy Aging, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell","Increase your number of healthy years by following this 7-day Mediterranean diet meal plan to help promote longevity, created by a dietitian.",https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-11681866,health,"What’s the secret to a long, healthy life? Certainly genetics play a role, as does a little bit of luck. That said, lifestyle factors, such as nutrition habits and physical activity, definitely matter too. With so much nutrition and health information out there, it’s hard to know what we should actually be doing to add length (and quality!) to our lives. Fortunately, there’s one style of eating that may help. Research links following the super-popular Mediterranean diet with a longer “healthy life expectancy,” meaning it may extend the number of years someone lives without chronic diseases or injuries. Wondering how to start? Follow this seven-day Mediterranean diet meal plan to help promote longevity.

Why This Meal Plan Is Great for You

This meal plan incorporates the principles of the Mediterranean diet by including a wide variety of plant-based foods, such vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains. You’ll also find an array of protein-rich foods, like fish, shellfish, soy, poultry, eggs and dairy. We limit refined grains, such as white flour, and added sugars as well as processed meats.

Each day provides an average of 99 grams of protein. Protein is often emphasized for its role in satiety and muscle growth, and protein intake also plays a pivotal role in healthy aging. Research shows that adequate protein intake in middle age, especially from plant-based sources, increases the odds of healthy aging. We also include an average of 33 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is an important nutrient with many health benefits, and research shows that it can play an important role in supporting a long, healthy life. One study found that high fiber intake reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adults with hypertension, while another study showed that high fiber consumption improved cognitive function in adults over age 60.

This 1,800-calorie meal plan has modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories to support those with different calorie needs. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.

Frequently Asked Questions ​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like? Definitely, if there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to mix and match with other recipes in this plan or browse all of our healthy aging, high-protein and high-fiber recipes for additional inspiration. To promote healthy aging, we prioritized recipes rich in fiber and protein and included plenty of plant-based foods.

Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day? Yes, if it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, go for it! The breakfasts range from 374 to 453 calories, while the lunches span 413 to 535 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two to fit your personal nutrition goals.

Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories? We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.

Strategies to Help Promote Longevity

While there’s no one strategy that will guarantee greater longevity, it’s clear that some nutrition and lifestyle factors can help increase the length and quality of our years.

Eat More Protein: Protein intake in middle age, especially from plant-based sources, increases the odds of healthy aging. Adequate protein intake is particularly important for older adults. Eating sufficient protein helps prevent and delay age-related muscle loss, which is important because good muscle tone and strength can help preserve good balance and reduce fall risk as we age.

LOS ANGELES, CA — In one of the worst flu seasons of the 21st century, influenza is currently deadlier than COVID-19 in California for the first time since the before the pandemic.

While the spread of COVID-19 is currently low in the Golden State, influenza is still spreading at high levels, and it's hitting young people and seniors particularly hard this year, according to the California Department of Public Health. Since the start of the flu season, which began in the fall and peaked in early February, 751 people have died from the flu in California as of Feb. 8, according to death certificates analyzed by the California Department of Public Health. Among those, flu claimed the lives of 563 people 64 or older and 11 people 18 or younger, including several teens.

In many cases, people are being hospitalized due to severe complications triggered by the illness. In deadly pediatric cases, patients experienced neurologic complications, including brain swelling. Among adults hospitalized with the flu, specialists are seeing an increase in cases of pneumonia caused by MRSA, a flesh-eating superbug bacteria, CNN reported.

“We’re seeing a lot of MRSA pneumonia and really bad MRSA pneumonia after influenza, so what we call necrotizing, where you’re getting a lot of destruction of the lung tissue,” said Dr. John Lynch, an infectious disease specialist at UW Medicine told CNN. The flu is spreading at very high rates in California, accounting for nearly 27 percent of clinical lab detections statewide and 3.4 percent of total deaths for the week ending Feb. 8, the most recent reporting available.

The Walgreens Flu Index an online, interactive tool that tracks weekly flu activity based on prescription data, shows that overall, U.S. flu activity is 204% higher compared to the same time last year. “What’s most concerning is not the number of cases but the number of hospitalizations and outpatient visits that we are seeing,” said Anita Pael, vice president of pharmacy services development at Walgreens said in a Walgreens news release. “I don’t believe cases have peaked yet, so it’s critical for people to remember to wash their hands frequently, and if you’re feeling symptoms, get tested right away.”","In one of the worst flu seasons of the 21st century, influenza is currently deadlier than COVID-19 in California for the first time since the before the pandemic.

At a Glance Researchers estimated that 42% of Americans over age 55 will eventually develop dementia.

Aging of the U.S. population is expected to cause the number of new dementia cases per year to double by 2060.

The findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent dementia and provide more help for those with dementia.

Dementia affects more than 6 million Americans and accounts for more than 100,000 deaths each year. Knowing people’s lifetime risk of dementia can lead to improved prevention efforts. It can also inform public health planning by generating projections of future cases.

Previous estimates of lifetime dementia risk in the United States are 11-14% for men and 19-23% for women. But these are based on older data in which dementia wasn’t reliably documented and early-stage cases were often missed. These data were also typically limited to non-Hispanic White populations.

A research team led by Drs. Josef Coresh at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and Michael Fang at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health generated updated estimates of lifetime dementia risk across different subsets of the population. They also projected the number of people who would be newly diagnosed with dementia in the U.S. between 2020 and 2060. Results appeared in Nature Medicine on January 13, 2025.

The team analyzed data on more than 15,000 people from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. All the people studied were free of dementia at age 55. More than a quarter were Black, and more than half were women. About 31% had at least one copy of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOEε4) gene variant, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

The team primarily relied on in-person evaluations. For participants who didn’t come in person, they used phone-based cognitive assessments. They also examined hospital records and death certificates for dementia diagnoses.

The researchers estimated a lifetime risk of dementia of 42% after age 55, more than double previous estimates. The dementia risk was 4% by age 75 and 20% by age 85, with the majority of the risk occurring after 85. Certain groups had greater risks than others. For example, women had a higher lifetime risk due to survival to older ages, 48% versus 35% in men. People with two APOEε4 copies had a lifetime risk of almost 60%, versus 48% for those with one copy and 39% for those with none.

The team applied their lifetime risk estimates to future population projections from the U.S. Census. They projected that the number of new dementia cases in the U.S. will double over the next four decades, from about 514,000 in 2020 to about 1 million in 2060.

The study suggests that the lifetime risk of dementia may be much higher than previously thought. This highlights an urgent need for policies that promote healthy aging. Interventions targeted toward high-risk individuals could help reduce the societal burdens of dementia.

“The pending population boom in dementia cases poses significant challenges for health policymakers, in particular, who must refocus their efforts on strategies to minimize dementia risk and the severity of dementia cases, as well as plans to provide more health care services for those with dementia,” Coresh says.

People are flocking to backyard chickens: Protect them from bird flu - Deseret News,How does bird flu spread? What is avian influenza? Can people get bird flu from backyard chickens? How can you prevent bird flu? Read more,https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/02/18/avian-influenza-protect-backyard-chickens-bird-flu/,health,"KEY POINTS Backyard chickens are becoming more popular, especially with millennials and Gen Z.

Avian influenza can hurts or even kill backyard flocks, so precautions are needed.

The risk of transmission to humans remains low, but it can happen.

As the popularity of keeping backyard and urban chicken flocks grows, health and agriculture experts warn that bird flu can pose a risk to your feathered friends — and by extension, a small risk to you, as well.

Estimates vary on how many people have backyard chickens. But the number, regardless of who does the count, is significant. In 2023, an American Pet Products Association’s pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That’s especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.

Baltimore Magazine put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.

Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

How bird flu spreads

Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that’s the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.

People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.

The CDC emphasizes that “no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.”

Spotting a sick flock

Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Protecting yourself if you have chickens

CDC’s guide for backyard flock owners offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:

Don’t touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment (PPE).

Always wear PPE around sick or dead birds. Ideal PPE includes safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.

Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Don’t touch your PPE until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,

Never wear used PPE in your home.

When cleaning and disinfecting, don’t stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you’re done, toss the PPE or clean it properly.

You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.

To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.

Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.

Cats and dogs at risk?

Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.

The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk.","Avian influenza can hurt or even kill backyard flocks, so precautions are needed. The risk of transmission to humans remains low, but it can happen. Backyard chickens are becoming more popular, especially with millennials and Gen Z."

After A$AP Rocky’s acquittal in the highly publicized trial, Rihanna shared a photo on her Instagram Stories, revealing that she was “humbled.” She wrote in the note that “the glory belongs to God and God alone” before announcing she is “thankful” for her partner’s not guilty verdict. The Fenty Beauty founder, who shares sons RZA and Riot Rose with A$AP Rocky, exhibited unwavering support by attending court proceedings.

A$AP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, faced two felony counts of assault in connection with a 2021 shooting case. The BBC mentioned that a former friend, Terell Ephron, accused Mayers of firing shots at him over an argument. However, Mayers denied the allegations, claiming it was a prop gun and alleging that Ephron, who goes by A$AP Relli, had financial motives. The two had known each other since high school and the alleged incident occurred on November 6 not far from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Blake Lively Alleges Justin Baldoni Made Other Women “Uncomfortable” On ‘It Ends With Us’ & Says They Will Testify At Trial; Defamation Claim Added To Suit - Deadline,"In a 141-page amended complaint, Blake Lively says other women who were uncomfortable around Justin Baldoni will testify at trial, adds defamation claim",http://deadline.com/2025/02/blake-lively-latest-lawsuit-justin-baldoni-1236294318/,entertainment,"With minutes to spare before a court-imposed deadline of midnight ET Tuesday, lawyers for Blake Lively have just filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star and director.

In a legal and cultural landscape where the blast radius from this battle was already pretty large, things just got a whole lot bigger, with more women cited in the amendment.

Also, with a settlement nowhere in sight, mediation rejected by all sides and contested telecom subpoenas, this saga of alleged misconduct, astroturfing and career crash-and-burning now finds Lively adding a defamation claim and civil conspiracy in her 141-page FAC (First Amended Complaint). There are also two new but not unexpected defendants in crisis PR firm Street Relations and its founder Jed Wallace.

Other Women

Perhaps more importantly, this time, in a complaint 48 pages longer than the New Year’s Eve complaint Lively first filed, there are at least two other women cited who allegedly suffered from the actions of Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Heath. The individuals’ names are left out of the document for now, but it notes that they intend to be witnesses in the trial starting next year in New York City federal court.

Watch on Deadline

Seeking to get Baldoni’s amended complaint dismissed, Lively’s amended complaint puts new emphasis on the harassment and the retaliation she detailed in previous filings. It states:

“The dangerous climate of threats, harassment, and intimidation fueled by the Defendants’ retaliation campaign has required Ms. Lively to alter her personal and professional life, and to take steps to protect innocent bystanders rather than exposing them to further harm. Thus, this Amended Complaint does not refer to certain witnesses by name, nor does it provide screen shots of their text messages. Importantly, however, these witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share the substance of their communications in this Amended Complaint as contained herein, and they will testify and produce responsive documents in the discovery process.”

Lively’s new filing claims Sony production executive Ange Giannetti was aware of the unease Lively and other women allegedly felt on IEWU. It goes on to say:

“More importantly, the Defendants’ false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth that Ms. Lively was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni and raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023, not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the Film in 2024. The experiences of Ms. Lively and others were documented at the time they occurred starting in May of 2023. Importantly, and contrary to the entire narrative Defendants have invented, Mr. Baldoni acknowledged the complaints in writing at the time. He knew that women other than Ms. Lively also were uncomfortable and had complained about his behavior.”

Also, with many meetings, instances and reproduced text messages repeated from Lively’s first court filing at the end of last year (such as the apparent derailment of “the long-planned launch of her haircare line, Blake Brown” because of the alleged online smear campaign), tonight’s amended complaint seeks to illustrate the stakes in some very real and potentially frightening ways:

“The Defendants’ actions have created such a toxic climate of online vitriol against Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, and various fact witnesses, that all of the above have received disturbing threats. One fact witness known to publicly support Ms. Lively recently received a written threat indicating that the witness’s family would be sexually assaulted and killed unless the witness agreed to ‘make a statement and give the truth’ This type of climate was the predictable, if not inevitable, result of the retaliatory campaign launched by the Baldoni-Wayfarer parties, both before and after the litigation began.”

Read Blake Lively’s 141-page amended complaint against Justin Baldoni and others here.

Like the January 31 FAC that Baldoni and crew filed against Lively and Ryan Reynolds for defamation and extortion, replacing their initial $400 million complaint of January 16, Tuesday’s paperwork from Lively supplants her NYE suit that followed the December 20 filing in California’s Civil Rights department.

In both FACs, new defendants were added. In Baldoni’s case, it was the New York Times after he sued them individually December 31 for $250 million. Tonight, Lively brought onboard Street Relations chief and alleged social media manipulator Wallace along with previous defendants Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, its CEO and its moneyman, plus publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel and Nathan’s The Agency Group.

The inclusion of Wallace and Street Relations was anticipated over the past few weeks.

However, with a desired protective order against lead Team Baldoni lawyer Bryan Freedman coming up short with Judge Lewis J. Liman in the case’s first hearing earlier this month, the defamation claim now takes on an even more pointed role — with the former Megyn Kelly lawyer named specifically. “The statements Wayfarer, Baldoni, and Heath, through their agents, including Bryan Freedman, published about Ms. Lively are reasonably understood to state and imply that Ms. Lively fabricated claims of harassment and filed false claims of harassment with the Civil Rights Department of the State of California and with this Court,” the section on the defamation claim says.

Lively’s Camp Issues Statement

After the FAC was put in the court docket just before Wednesday ET, Lively’s main attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb outlined for Deadline where things are and where they see this all going.

“Ms. Lively has filed an amended complaint today that provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims. That evidence includes previously undisclosed communications involving Ms. Lively, representatives of Sony and Wayfarer, and numerous other witnesses. The complaint includes significant contemporaneous evidence that Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited; as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants’ retaliatory campaign.

“The amended complaint has also added a new claim for defamation based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint, and adds Jed Wallace and his company as defendants.

Over the next several weeks, we will move to dismiss the utterly meritless lawsuits brought against Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds, and we will move full speed ahead with discovery that we expect will reveal shocking details about the depth to which the Defendants have sunk in their unending efforts to ‘bury,’ ‘ruin,’ and ‘destroy’ Ms. Lively and her family.”

Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively in ‘It Ends With Us’ Sony

Representatives for Baldoni and the other defendants, Freedman and Sony did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on Tuesday’s filing. If any of them do, this post will be updated.

More To Come

With more than a year to go before trial is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2026, it is likely (like, certain) that there will be more filings. Tonight’s filings don’t even include the other lawsuits orbiting what went on during production of IEWU and the retaliation Lively alleges she was subjected to online last summer by Baldoni’s publicists Nathan and Abel, along with self-described “hired gun” Wallace.

Lively’s team recently pulled a deposition demand in Texas against Wallace as a prelude to putting his name and his company in the new amended complaint. On February 5, after Wallace denied he had anything to do with a smear campaign (despite what seem like references to him by Baldoni flacks in text messages), the Texas-based entrepreneur sued Lively for $7 million. Wallace asserted that his name being in Lively’s CRD complaint and coming up several times in the matter since has caused him “millions of dollars in reputational harm with a projected loss to his company that exceeds another million.”

It should be noted that Nathan and Abel have also said they never actually activated attacks on Lively in the lead-up to the August 2024 release of Sony’s It Ends With Us, “because the internet was doing the work for us,” as Abel wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post just before Christmas.

Now, just days after Lively and Reynolds walked the red carpet at 30 Rock and participated in the SNL50: The Anniversary Special, the internet will get busy and Wallace has been hauled into the big show. A show that is sure to get a lot wilder before next year’s trial start date comes around.",Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star.

There are no restrictions to shopping or important decisions. The moon is in Scorpio.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

A positive day

This is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. For four months, issues related to home and family have been muddled, confused and delayed. Fortunately, in the next 10 days, you’ll see a light at the end of the tunnel — and it won’t be a train.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

An average day

Discussions with spouses, partners, friends and groups will be practical and sensible today. Possibly, someone older or more experienced will have advice for you. If so, listen. (This might be challenging to do because you feel rebellious and restless today.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

A positive day

This is a productive day for you! Furthermore, it’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do. Think about long-term goals. Someone more experienced than you might have advice. (It never hurts to listen, because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A positive day

Because you’re in a practical frame of mind, you can learn and study. You can also make advances in a serious writing project or a manuscript. Or you can deal with the myriad details involved in planning a vacation. However, parents should be vigilant about their kids to avoid accidents.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

An average day

Tread carefully when dealing with authority figures today because something unexpected might happen. They might refuse a request or make an unusual demand or do something that you least expect. Therefore, play your cards close to your chest. Be sensible about financial matters.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

An average day

Pay attention to everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for you. On the upside, you might have some brilliant, genius-like ideas. Meanwhile, discussions with partners and spouses will be practical and sensible. Good time to wrap things up.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

An average day

Keep an eye on your money and your possessions because this is an unpredictable day for your assets. You might find money; you might lose money. Be smart and protect what you own against loss, theft or damage. Meanwhile, this is a productive day at work. Expect results.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

A positive day

Results will come to you today through willing acceptance of duty and obligation to others, especially children or partners in creative ventures. Do what you can to keep things practical and orderly. (Expect a few surprises from someone close to you.)

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

An average day

Today you might be dealing with hidden, private issues. (Or perhaps, you yourself might want to be hidden from others?) Practical discussions about home and family issues will take place. Meanwhile, something related to your job, your pet or your health might surprise you.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

An average day

You might meet a character today or someone you know (perhaps a friend or a member of a group) will do something that surprises you. Or perhaps the mandate of a group has changed in a way that surprises you? Meanwhile, this is a good day to tidy up the details of your everyday world.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

An average day

Be respectful when dealing with parents, bosses, teachers and the police today because their response to you might catch you off guard. (Never underestimate the power of courtesy.) Meanwhile, serious discussions about your assets and earnings might take place. Do your homework.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

A positive day

Be mindful of everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for your sign. Meanwhile, this is an excellent day to study and learn new things because you have perseverance and focus. You won’t overlook details. Some will focus on travel.

If your birthday is today

Actress Millie Bobby Brown (2004) shares your birthday. You are an independent problem solver who is sensitive to the needs of others. You are also mystical and artistic. This year, it’s your turn to socialize and have fun! Let your guard down and loosen up a bit. Old friends may reappear to rekindle relationships.

","Aries (March 21-April 19) is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. It’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do."

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The Los Angeles home of actress Nicole Kidman and musician Keith Urban was burglarized on Valentine's Day, sources told ABC News.

Around 8 p.m. Friday, the Los Angeles Police Department received a report of a burglary and responded to the celebrity couple's home.

Police say an unknown number of suspects smashed a glass door, ransacked the home and then took off. It's not clear what, if anything, was taken.

Kidman and Urban were not home at the time, and sources say it's not believed they were targeted.

The case is the latest burglary case nationwide involving celebrity victims.

ESPN reports LAFC soccer player Olivier Giroud lost approximately $500,000 worth of jewelry when his L.A. home was burglarized earlier this month.

Giroud, France's all-time top goal scorer, had 10 luxury watches stolen from him, a source told ESPN. The striker and his family were not at the property at the time.

The incident was reported to police early this month.

B.J. Novak gives loving tribute to Office costar Mindy Kaling: 'We always knew you'd be famous' - Entertainment Weekly News,"Ryan and Kelly forever! B.J. Novak gives adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) for his 'The Office' costar Mindy Kaling's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony: 'We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the …",https://ew.com/bj-novak-loving-tribute-office-costar-mindy-kaling-11682104,entertainment,"Heads up Office fans — Ryan and Kelly are together again, this time for a very special reason.

B.J. Novak was on hand Tuesday for Mindy Kaling's ceremony to receive her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and gave an adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) at the event in her honor. After first meeting on the beloved sitcom in 2004, the duo, much like their aforementioned characters, had an on-again, off-again relationship in the early aughts, but ultimately ended that in 2007, and have been close friends ever since.

So it only made sense that Novak, who is also godfather to Kaling's three children, would be there to say a few words in support of the star.

He began by touting her many accomplishments in Hollywood — The Office, The Mindy Project, her many books and executive producing credits, to name a few — before joking, “at this point after all these successes, you also just know her from being famous, and that’s the part I want to say a few words about.”



""Mindy respects and understands [fame] in a very intuitive way because in addition to being a brilliant and wildly successful showrunner, an incredible mother of three, a deep and caring daughter and friend and mentor to so many, Mindy is also in her spare time, I assure you, very superficial,"" he joked.



Novak continued, citing Kaling's love of red carpet drama, wanting to know ""what really happened on the junket,"" and genuine interest in ""who wore it better.""

""She understands what fame means to people because she’s a normal person and it means something to her,"" he added. ""She knows it can be fun and interesting. She knows it can be inspiring. She knows it can be false and unfair and misleading and she knows it’s human nature to be curious about all of it. And as a result, even though it’s a job you can never fully control, it’s a job she handles beautifully.""

Getting emotional, he looked at his friend and said, “Mindy, as I look around and see all these people from your life who have believed in you from the beginning, I’m just sorry that none of us doubted you, because I know how much more fun that would make this for you. But we couldn’t help it. We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the job.”

""You'd be on the walk of talent if they had one,"" he concluded. ""You'd be on the walk of friendship. You'd be on the walk of compassionate parenthood, but let's face it all of these would be terrible field trips, so here you are instead, very deservedly, a person who means so much to so many on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.""



The lovefest wasn't just one-sided, though. Kaling also gave a shoutout to her longtime pal, whom she thanked on stage, calling him ""such an important and integral part of my family, that sometimes I forget the reason that I know him is because we worked together professionally, and I'm just as starstruck by him now, at 29, than I was when I first met you, at 24. I love you.""

Top TNA Star Appears On WWE NXT - https://wrestletalk.com/,"A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight's WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.",https://wrestletalk.com/news/top-tna-star-appears-wwe-nxt-moose/,entertainment,"tna

A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight’s WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.

Tonight’s WWE NXT show was the first show since this past weekend’s WWE Vengeance Day event, which saw Oba Femi retain his NXT Championship against both Grayson Waller and Austin Theory.

After the match, Femi was jumped by the mysterious new group that made their mark on the show, who left him laying with an attack after his defence.

To kick off tonight’s NXT show, Oba came to the ring, where he called out the four men that took him out, but it wasn’t them who answered his call.

Instead, out came former TNA World Champion and current TNA X-Division Champion Moose, making his first ever appearance on NXT television amid the ongoing partnership between the two companies.

Moose got into the ring, where he challenged Oba to a match, saying that Moose vs. Oba Femi ‘has’ to happen.

Oba seemingly accepted his challenge, saying it ‘will’ happen, though no official date was given.

Moose is a current member of the System in TNA alongside Brian Myers, Eddie Edwards, Alisha Edwards and JDC.

JDC made his return to NXT television last week, where he lost to Lexis King in a Heritage Cup match.

Jay-Z Claims Now Dismissed Rape Case Cost Him $20M In Lost Income; Was Timed To Embarrass Daughter Blue Ivy At ‘Mufasa’ Premiere - Deadline,Jay-Z claims now dismissed rape of a minor case cost him millions in biz opportunities & tried to shame him with Beyoncé & Blue Ivy.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/jay-z-extortion-case-latest-sean-diddy-combs-1236293993/,entertainment,"The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Jay-Z and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on.

Filed four days before the Buzbee-represented Jane Doe “voluntarily dismissed with prejudice” her claims, Jay-Z (aka Shawn Carter) made a declaration in the docket of Los Angeles Superior Court ripping the Texas-based attorney. Rejecting Buzbee’s attempt to have the Roc Nation boss’ defamation and extortion suit essentially gutted, Jay-Z’s February 10 filing says the “career-ending” accusations of assaulting a 13-year-old girl unsurprisingly damaged his business and his family — the former to the tune of $20 million a year.

While not mentioning the NFL, with which Roc Nation has a recently renewed Super Bowl Halftime Show deal, Jay-Z’s declaration makes clear that even if the Roger Goodell-run league was standing by him, others were much less inclined to do so:

“Mr. Buzbee’s actions undermined my relationship, and my company Roc Nation’s relationship, with other businesses in the sports and entertainment space,” the filing states. “We have agreements to produce entertainment programs for certain sporting events. After Mr. Buzbee filed the lawsuit, the media reported that other businesses could end their deals with Roc Nation, and forced one to speak out and address whether these false allegations would end our business relationship.

“Immediately after Mr. Buzbee went public with his false accusations, my company Roc Nation also lost other contracts in the sports and entertainment space that would have generated revenues of approximately $20 million per year.”

The rape of the then-teen Jane Doe is alleged to have occurred on the night of September 7, 2000 during one of Diddy’s drug-fueled parties after that year’s MTV VMAs. A graphic October 20, 2024 lawsuit from Buzbee first only named Combs, but made distinct reference to accomplices cited as male “Celebrity A” and a female “Celebrity B.” Jay-Z was named as “Celebrity A” in a December 8 refiling by Buzbee, which followed separate November 18 suit from a Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan-represented anonymous “celebrity and public figure who resides in Los Angeles” (later revealed to be Jay-Z) that went after the Texas lawyer for extortion.

After a flurry of filings, including several unsuccessful attempts at dismissal, one problematic NBC News sit-down featuring the now middle-aged Jane Doe and other media duels, the whole matter was pulled on February 14 by the plaintiff with no explanation by Buzbee.

On the other hand, Jay-Z said in a statement posted that day on Roc Nation’s X feed: “I would not wish this experience on anyone. The trauma that my wife, my children, loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed.”

In fact, on February 10, the multi-Grammy winner also got specific about what he viewed as a hit on him timing-wise when he was publicly named December 8.

“I was harshly criticized by others for accompanying my daughter to the premiere of her movie a day after Mr. Buzbee filed the Jane Doe lawsuit against me,” Jay-Z said of the full-tilt December 9 Los Angeles premiere of the Barry Jenkins-directed Mufasa: The Lion King that he attended with daughter Blue Ivy and his wife Beyoncé. “Media outlets reported that Disney was hesitant over my attendance at the premiere because of the accusations. I feel that Mr. Buzbee purposely filed this lawsuit on the eve of my daughter’s premiere to put me in the position of having to choose between supporting my daughter or hiding to avoid the negative press coverage.

“Buzbee’s assertion that there is nothing ‘extreme and outrageous’ about his false public claims that Mr. Carter is a serial child rapist is erroneous and appalling,” states an accompanying 22-page opposition to defendant’s motion to strike.

Despite all the citations of threats, alleged multiple victims, strong-arming by Buzbee for “something of substance” from Jay-Z for his clients, and the hip-hop icon’s attendance at big NFL games and the Grammys in recent weeks, this could all be DOA now, though a February 25 hearing in downtown L.A. remains on the books.

Deadline reached out to lawyers for both Jay-Z and Jane Doe for comment and clarification on the state of affairs, but the filing of judicial notice Tuesday in LASC may provide a clue.

In that paperwork, Jay-Z lawyer Robert M. Schwartz did note the February 14 dismissal in NYC and stressed, “given that Mr. Buzbee filed the dismissal four days after Mr. Carter filed his opposition to the anti-SLAPP Motion (on February 10), Mr. Carter could not have made the dismissal a part of his opposition.” The attorney added: “The voluntary dismissal with prejudice is relevant to Mr. Carter’s opposition to Defendants’ pending Special Motion to Strike (‘anti-SLAPP Motion’), which attacks the legal and factual bases of Mr. Carter’s claims for extortion, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

“The gravamen of Mr. Carter’s claims is that Mr. Buzbee failed to properly investigate Jane Doe’s claims before Mr. Buzbee publicly accused Mr. Carter of rape and threatened to refer him to law enforcement authorities, and then demanded that Mr. Carter pay his client ‘something of substance’ to buy her silence and avoid a ‘public spectacle’ and litigation.”

Schwartz goes on to make another point in today’s filing: “The factfinder in this case can reasonably infer from the voluntary dismissal that Buzbee’s public statements that Mr. Carter had raped Jane Doe were false, making them defamatory.”

Perhaps this is about to become a West Coast war now.

As for Combs, who still faces dozens of assault and abuse civil suits from Buzbee-represented plaintiffs and others, he remains behind bars at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center where he has been since his September 16 arrest. Failing on multiple occasions to get released on $50 million bail and looking at life in prison if found guilty, the Bad Boy Records founder is set to go to trial on racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges starting May 5.

It’s unlikely that Jay-Z will be showing up at that event, though even without him it will certainly be a spectacle.","The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Roc Nation boss and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on. In a February 10 filing, Jay-z made a declaration ripping the Texas-based attorney."
Of Course Justin Baldoni’s Lawyer Saw Ryan Reynolds’s SNL Cameo - Vulture,What — did you think a singular sentence from Ryan Reynolds alluding to the Justin Baldoni–Blake Lively legal drama during ‘SNL50’ wouldn’t somehow become a thing?,http://www.vulture.com/article/justin-baldoni-ryan-reynolds-snl50.html,entertainment,"Baldoni and Reynolds. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: John Nacion/Variety via Getty Images, Saturday Night Live via YouTube

No cultural institution is safe from somehow being implicated in the Blake Lively x Justin Baldoni drama. This week, it’s Saturday Night Live. Next week, we presume, it will be the Metropolitan Opera. Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds, made an appearance on SNL50, which aired on February 16, during a sketch helmed by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in which they answered audience members’ questions. In the sketch, Fey asks Reynolds how it’s going. “Great,” Reynolds responds. “Why? What have you heard?” Fey replies, “Good stuff only,” as Reynolds launches into a question about the Coneheads. A source on Baldoni’s legal team told “Page Six,” in response to the sketch, “Justin is taking this lawsuit in all seriousness and isn’t making a public mockery out of it.”

On February 17, Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded. “I’m unaware of anybody, frankly, whose wife has been sexually harassed and has made jokes about that type of situation,” Freedman said on the podcast Hot Mics With Billy Bush. “I can’t think of anyone who’s done anything like that. It surprised me.”

The legal drama stems from Baldoni and Lively’s time filming It Ends With Us, which Baldoni directed and both starred in. Lively filed a lawsuit in December 2024 against Baldoni and his crisis-PR team, alleging that Baldoni “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed,” then hired a crisis-PR team to retaliate against her in the press. Baldoni then filed a separate lawsuit against the New York Times as well as Lively, Reynolds, and their PR team, alleging defamation and civil extortion. The updates on the drama have since been never-ending, and SNL now gets to be a footnote in yet another crucial moment of the past half-century. Congrats to Lorne!",Ryan Reynolds appeared on Saturday Night Live. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler asked audience members about the Coneheads. Baldoni's lawyer said he's not aware of anyone whose wife has been sexually harassed.
"Patricia Heaton says 'The Middle,' 'Everybody Loves Raymond' were TV 'perfection' and don't need reboots - Yahoo Entertainment","Patricia Heaton, whose most recent movie is ""The Unbreakable Boy,"" calls it ""a beautiful thing"" that TikTok has brought new fans to the sitcom ""The Middle.""",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/patricia-heaton-says-the-middle-everybody-loves-raymond-were-tv-perfection-and-dont-need-reboots-224747298.html,entertainment,"Patricia Heaton was a mainstay on television for two decades, thanks to the sitcoms Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle. Now, the actress has a question for Hollywood: ""Where's my reboot?""

Heaton, star of the new film The Unbreakable Boy, discussed with Yahoo Entertainment about all the shows getting the reboot or revival treatment these days on television. ""Why didn't I ever get on a show that could be rebooted?"" she joked. ""Because it seems like everybody [else is].""

In all seriousness, Heaton agreed with her former co-star Ray Romano, who recently told Yahoo that Everybody Loves Raymond should be left alone.

""It was just sort of perfection — and you don't wanna mess with perfection. You know, we've lost so many cast members, you couldn't reboot it because it won't be the same show,"" said Heaton, who starred as Debra Barone opposite Romano on the CBS sitcom from 1996 to 2005. The 66-year-old actress went on to reveal she has ""the same"" feelings about The Middle. ""Perfection.""

""The way they wrapped it up, where we got to flash-forward in the lives of the Heck family and see where they all ended up, it was so beautiful, and I think people have such a good feeling about the show,"" she explained. Heaton played the matriarch, Frankie Heck, from 2009 to 2018.

""The Middle is having such a resurgence on TikTok, of all places, that kids are rediscovering or discovering it for the first time. ... It's a beautiful thing,"" she said. ""It's like a great work of art — you don't need to go in there and touch it up or change it or do anything to it. Just let it be what it is. And the wonderful thing about TV and about streaming [is] you'll be able to enjoy it as much as you want.""

Heaton appears next in the inspirational film The Unbreakable Boy alongside Zachary Levi, Meghann Fahy and Jacob Laval. It's based on the true story of how a couple (played by Levi and Fahy) navigate raising their son Austin, who is autistic and has brittle bone disease. However, it's Austin's ""unbreakable"" spirit that ends up teaching his father how to live.

""I've been a big supporter of [the autism] community for my whole life,"" Heaton said, in explaining why she chose to make this movie. ""I have one son who had learning differences, and just that small thing can really just make you so worried. And I thought to myself, 'What about these parents who have a myriad of these differences in their children, and where did they turn?'"" She shares four adult children with her actor husband, David Hunt.

""I always worry about my kids and how they're gonna be in the world without me, and my kids are fine. How about families that have these issues? That's why a movie like this was so important when it came along. I wanted to be a part of it, because it's a story of triumph, and people need to see that,"" she said.

Winnie Harlow and NBA star Kyle Kuzma are officially engaged. The couple announced their betrothal on Tuesday via a collaborative Instagram post with no caption, just vibes and a close-up of the enormous 8.5 carat oval-cut diamond with two side baguettes sitting nicely on Harlow’s finger. Who needs words when you have a rock like that, anyway?

Kuzma popped the big question on February 13 right before they took off for Turks and Caicos in a private jet full of roses, chocolate, and balloons, according to their engagement announcement in Vogue. While the model and athlete have been dating since 2020, Kuzma told the outlet he’d been dreaming up the proposal since their first visit to the Caribbean island in 2022. Post-private-jet flight, Harlow was surprised by her friends, family, and a celebration dinner on the beach outside of their villa. Congratulations to them!

"Kevin Spacey Tells Guy Pearce to ‘Grow Up,’ Denies Claim He ‘Targeted’ Actor - Rolling Stone",Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to 'grow up' after the latter said his 'L.A. Confidential' co-star 'targeted' him while making the 1997 movie.,http://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kevin-spacey-dismisses-guy-pearce-claim-targeted-1235271640/,entertainment,"Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to “grow up” after Pearce claimed his former co-star “targeted” him when they worked together on L.A. Confidential.

Pearce has not leveled any specific allegations against Spacey, though in a 2018 interview, he called the actor a “handsy guy.” More recently, on the Awards Chatter podcast, Pearce said, “Even though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators… I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.”

In a video posted on X Tuesday, Feb. 18, Spacey responded, saying, “We worked together a long time ago. If I did something then that upset you, you could’ve reached out to me, we could’ve had that conversation.”

Spacey — who’s faced numerous claims of sexual misconduct, all of which he’s either denied or been cleared of in court — chastised Pearce for speaking on his experience to the press. He then complained that the press was “now coming after me because they’d like to know what my response is.” Spacey said, “You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”

Spacey went on to claim that after shooting L.A. Confidential Pearce traveled to Savannah, Georgia while he was filming Midnight in the Valley of Evil “just to spend time with me.” He questioned why Pearce did not mention that, saying, “Or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?” Spacey later alleged, “Maybe there was another reason, I don’t know. But that doesn’t make any sense that you would’ve just been leading me on, right?”

(Pearce did say on Awards Chatter that he “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin post-that that got ugly,” though did not specify what happened, or when.)

Spacey ended by saying, “But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I’ve been through hell and back to do what? Just in time to stop the bad guy. Is that what’s going on here? What took you so long? Did your horse run out of gas? I mean, you want to have a conversation, I’m happy to do so anytime, any place. We can even do it here live on X if you’d like, I’ve got nothing to hide. But Guy, you need to grow up. You are not a victim.”

Pearce said it wasn’t until “things came to light in 2017” that he started to comprehend the way Spacey had treated him on L.A. Confidential. At the time, he said, he would “brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing,’” adding that he was “scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man.”

When the other allegations against Spacey first emerged, Pearce said he “broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop.” He continued, “I think it really sort of dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had sort of either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever. That was a really incredible wake up call, I suppose.”","Guy Pearce said Kevin Spacey ""targeted"" him on L.A. Confidential.

'Bad Flu' Kept Dana Carvey Away From SNL's 50th - LateNighter,"We're now learning why one of Sunday night's SNL anniversary special's more conspicuous no-shows wasn't there.

For as much chatter as Sunday night’s star-packed SNL50: The Anniversary Special has generated since its broadcast, a disproportionate amount seems to have circled around the the famous alums who were not in attendance at the show.

We’re now learning why one of the more conspicuous no-shows wasn’t there.

Mike Schneider at Variety reports that “a bad flu” prevented Dana Carvey from participating in the show. Carvey had been a frequent presence on the show this season, playing the show’s Joe Biden through the election, and making additional appearances as The Church Lady, Elon Musk, and Al Pacino.

Carvey is expected to address his absence tomorrow when he catches up with David Spade in a new episode of their Fly on the Wall Podcast. (Spade was at the special, appearing in the John Mulaney-fronted “New York Musical” sketch.)

As we’ve reported, Bill Hader and Dan Aykroyd were also no-shows at the event. Aykroyd said as early as last August that he’d prefer to watch the show from home, while reps for Hader have said that he had a longstanding scheduling conflict.

Though the three former cast members were clearly missed, there were hundreds of others in attendance—so many, in fact, that some were apparently seated in a different studio entirely. The overflow crowd of former cast members, writers and others associated with the show was seated in Studio 8G (home to Late Night with Seth Meyers), where sources tell us drinks were served as attendees watched the proceedings taking place in the studio next door on monitors.",Dana Carvey was not in attendance at SNL50: The Anniversary Special.

"MAGA Outrage Over Tom Hanks’ ‘SNL50’ Sketch Is Understandable, Says Joy Behar: They Made ‘Anyone Who Voted for Trump Look Like a Racist’ - AOL",,https://www.aol.com/maga-outrage-over-tom-hanks-203727408.html,entertainment,"Tom Hanks’ surprise appearance at “SNL50” sparked Republican backlash on social media, but some outspoken Democrats such as “The View” co-host Joy Behar understand the outrage. Hanks popped up as Donald Trump supporter Doug during the anniversary show’s “Black Jeopardy” sketch, a character he first played on “SNL” eight years ago. Sporting a red MAGA hat, Doug freaks out when Kenan Thompson’s “Black Jeopardy” host goes to shake his hand.

“The fact remains that they’re making anyone who voted for Trump look like a racist, and that’s why they’re mad,” Behar said about the backlash. “I personally would never do that, because I don’t believe that any group is one thing.”

More from Variety

“A lot of these people [who voted for Trump], in my opinion, have been misled,” she continued. “They thought that grocery prices would come down. They’re up. They thought inflation was coming down. It’s up. They thought that Medicaid was safe. It’s not. They thought Social Security was safe. It’s not. So it’s not only racism that caused Trump to be in office. We have to remember that. So of course they’re going to be insulted.”

Behar’s “The View” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin previously worked in Trump’s White House and said she “personally thinks the outrage over it is a little overblown.”

“Saturday Night Live” alum Victoria Jackson told TMZ that she was upset by Hanks’ appearance, and she pointed to comments made by political commentator Link Lauren on X that called the sketch “disgusting.”

“Tom Hanks just came out on ‘SNL’ in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a Black man’s hand,” Lauren posted. “This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. ‘SNL’ is an unfunny show for snobbish liberal elites. The current Republican Party is a big tent coalition compromised (sic) of many former Democrats. Good riddance, ‘SNL!'”

The actor revealed an interview with GQ magazine that he’s turned down a few Marvel offers in the past because the pay just wasn’t sufficient enough.

“The reason I didn’t do them had nothing to do with any artistic considerations whatsoever,” Malkovich said. “I didn’t like the deals they made, at all. These films are quite grueling to make… If you’re going to hang from a crane in front of a green screen for six months, pay me. You don’t want to pay me, it’s cool, but then I don’t want to do it, because I’d rather be onstage, or be directing a play, or doing something else.”

What Malkovich was surprised to discover was that filming “The Fantastic Four” was “not that dissimilar to doing theater” because “you imagine a bunch of stuff that isn’t there and do your little play.” He told GQ that he took a role in the movie primarily because he wanted to work with director Matt Shakman again after 2014’s “Cut Bank.”

“I should have just taken the serum,” says Sam Wilson in Captain America: Brave New World. His refusal to turn himself into a super-soldier like his predecessor, Steve Rogers, is a point of pride; it’s also a liability in a world filled with what another character refers to as “enhanced individuals.” This version of Captain America can’t do much against an opponent amped up on Gamma radiation, and he knows it.

The idea of a superhero suffering from performance anxiety—if not impostor syndrome—is resonant right now, as cracks appear in Marvel’s gleaming foundations. The signature image of Avengers: Endgame, with rows and rows of good guys staring down faceless CGI hordes, was the perfect emblem for a front-running brand defined by synergy and abundance. (“You wanted more?” asks Benedict Wong’s Sorcerer Supreme not so rhetorically.) Yet, in some ways, Thanos had it right all along. Even in 2018, there were too many Avengers to keep track of. Somebody had to be expendable.

Marvel’s endgame has always been to delay the endgame as long as possible. Now, it seems to be in the process of self-checkmate. Last year, Louis D’Esposito, the copresident of Marvel Studios, was quoted in Empire admitting that it had been “a rough time” for the company: “Maybe when you do too much, you dilute yourself a little bit.” Such self-reflection is admirable, but the problems go beyond oversaturation: The weaknesses are in the movies themselves. Trying to remember a genuinely resonant image or line of dialogue in Shang-Chi, The Marvels, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania makes for an arduous stroll down memory lane; not even hiring Sam Raimi to play his greatest hits could make Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness feel less obligatory. What does it say that the most memorable Marvel properties of the past few years have been MCU-adjacent flops such as Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter, which have gone viral not in spite of their badness but as a direct result? It is no longer Morbin’ time. It may never be again.

The exception to this downward spiral was 2024’s Deadpool & Wolverine, a spectacularly obnoxious but conceptually shrewd movie that pandered to its edgelord demographic while deftly summarizing a mainstream vibe shift. Like Thanos, the film’s villains were efficiency experts with a mandate to downsize their own intellectual property. The difference was that, from his side of the fourth wall, our hero could sort of see where they were coming from. “You’re coming in at kind of a low point,” Deadpool cheerfully explains to his old pal Wolverine, who’s none too pleased to be resurrected after getting a humane send-off in Logan. Deadpool’s getting at something true about the cyclical nature of empires: They’re never really built to last, even when they’ve been reinforced with vibranium.

After being delayed for a year by extensive reshoots, Captain America: Brave New World—originally subtitled New World Order until that phrase proved a bit too sensitive—has come limping into view as the punch line to Deadpool’s joke. Not that anybody is laughing, exactly. Advance word was that Julius Onah’s film had suffered from a troubled production; a new behind-the-scenes report published in Vulture confirmed it, quoting an unnamed crew member as saying, “Everybody on the crew knew that [this] was not going to be a good film.” That’s blunt, but it’s also an understatement. If Brave New World isn’t the worst movie ever released under the Marvel banner, it might just be the dullest—a humorless, grayed-out vision of contractual obligation featuring actors who look like they’d rather be anywhere else. Say what you will about Madame Web, but there was something charming about its pulpy, unpretentious ineptitude. Between its omnipresent and hilarious ADR and Dakota Johnson’s inability to open a Pepsi can, Madame Web is an endearingly surreal viewing experience (one I have personally seen twice). Brave New World is for completists only. It isn’t camp. It isn’t kitsch. It isn’t even a noble failure that goes down swinging. It’s just feeble, a movie that forgot to take the serum.

Usually when a big-budget movie like this goes wrong, it’s the director who ends up getting thrown under the bus. That’s not fair to Onah, whose last movie, Luce, about a Black student who runs afoul of his school’s administration, was full of bristling and contradictory ideas. His recruitment here indicates that Brave New World was supposed to be one of Marvel’s “serious” movies, and the setup feints at political complexity. It begins at the presidential inauguration of the feared and respected U.S. military commander General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who was played in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk by the late William Hurt behind a righteous mustache; we learn that in order to level up to the Oval Office, Ross—now played by Harrison Ford—had to ditch the soup strainer or risk the ire of focus groups everywhere.

Ross’s platform is “togetherness.” Apparently, there are a lot of single-issue voters out there. His biggest administrative dilemma is what to do about Tiamut, the “celestial island” that surfaced in the Indian Ocean at the end of Eternals, which contains the sort of bountiful, valuable natural resources that could bring global allies to the brink of war. Hoping to shed his image as a warmonger—and, in doing so, to redeem himself in the eyes of the daughter he alienated several movies/decades ago—Ross plans to share Tiamut’s adamantium with the rest of the free world. His presentation to a group of world leaders plays, amusingly, like an infomercial, or maybe a Marvel Studios shareholders meeting.

These plans for unity are waylaid following an assassination attempt at the White House with Sam in the house. The shooter is Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), the towering Korean War veteran—and “forgotten Captain America” introduced in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. As a former military guinea pig who was held in prison for 30 years, Isaiah has every reason to want revenge, but his confusion after pulling the trigger hints that he may be a Manchurian candidate. Sam is determined to clear his mentor’s name, which means going off the grid with the help of the next would-be Falcon, Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), and figuring out where the administration has gotten compromised. Between skirmishes with a freelance hitman played by Giancarlo Esposito and visits to a top-secret military facility—plot points that could both come from a game of Marvel Mad Libs—Sam uncovers (wait for it) a larger conspiracy designed to destabilize the ruling geopolitical empire for good.

It took five screenwriters to produce the script for Brave New World, which is light on inventive twists or memorable dialogue. What it does have is a lot of exposition, which is parceled out mostly through impromptu briefings. That’s what storytelling has become in the MCU: an extended game of catch-up favoring viewers whose security clearance is a yearly subscription to a streaming service. For all the hand-wringing about international aggression and mutually assured destruction, what’s really at stake is not the price of adamantium or the threat of nuclear war but the maintenance of continuity. What does it say that the movie’s not-so-secret Big Bad is basically a statistician whose MO is calculating probabilities? We’re supposed to hate him for trying to weaponize percentages against the good guys, but he’s actually the perfect avatar for a studio whose brain trust has historically gotten rich by hedging its bets.

If there’s a sympathetic figure in this quagmire, it’s Anthony Mackie, a charismatic actor who’s been waiting a decade for his above-the-title moment. While promoting the movie in Rome, he raised eyebrows by telling an interviewer, “Captain America represents a lot of different things, and I don’t think the term, you know, ‘America’ should be one of those representations.” While Mackie ended up walking things back by saying he was a “proud American” and that he supported the troops, his observation connects to Brave New World’s seriously janky politics. One reason the first Captain America worked was because it successfully yoked its hero’s sense of moral clarity to a throwback World War II narrative; the ’70s-paranoid-thriller qualities of The Winter Soldier were overstated but relatively fresh the first time around. At this point, whatever mileage there was to get out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra has been exhausted, and Sam’s idealism makes him look less like a paragon than a sap.

It’s never clear why Sam remains faithful to a government that kept a Black war hero locked away for so long, or why he tries to see the best in Ross, who spent his career trying to keep the Avengers off the board. He’s told at one point that his optimism makes him an “inspiration,” which sounds nice, especially coming from Sebastian Stan in “just here for the day” mode. It’s hard to take, though, in a cynically packaged narrative that’s about little more than upholding the status quo. (The peripheral presence of Black Widow operative Ruth Bat-Seraph, played by Shira Haas—who’s never referred to by her comic book moniker of Sabra but is directly identified as Israeli—has also been a point of controversy, with protestors calling for a boycott at the film’s premiere.)

Vulture’s article refers to Harrison Ford being unhappy on set, which is hardly news, but his frustration bleeds into his performance as Ross. He hasn’t been given much to play. His entire role is waiting for the other shoe to drop, or rather to explode when a big red foot bursts through it. It’s not a spoiler alert to reveal that Ross contains multitudes—Brave New World’s entire ad campaign depended on the promise of a Red Hulk. The image of an elected official rampaging through Washington, destroying everything he touches while waiting for somebody to talk him down—or blow him up—has some symbolic currency at the moment. Accidental prescience isn’t the same thing as satire, though, and Brave New World doesn’t commit to the metaphor in any sustained way. A funnier movie would have featured Red Hulk signing executive orders.

Last weekend, a friend of mine in Toronto went viral when he wondered if film critics should even have to review Marvel releases anymore. It was a good question: Brave New World made nearly $90 million domestically on opening weekend, which is considerably less than its predecessors, but still enough to suggest a certain impenetrable layer of critic-proofing. Though, at this point, it’s less about criticism—or even consumer reporting—than keeping tabs on something immense as it wobbles around on rubber legs. The recurring image of Tiamut, massive and half-submerged as various factions try to strip-mine it, is poetic in a way that doesn’t totally feel intended. It’s like a Marvel movie taking place among its own ruins.

It’s a Marvel tradition that its movies all have (at least) two endings: a final sequence and a stinger that, in theory, justifies sitting through 10 minutes of end credits. Brave New World lowers the bar on both fronts in a way that somehow suggests both a guilty conscience and complete disdain. There’s a conversation between Sam and Joaquin about the pressures of being a hero and the need to rise to meet opportunities. It’s almost as if Marvel is promising to do better next time. The stinger, meanwhile, features a locked-down villain vowing to send for reinforcements. “There will be others,” says the bad guy ominously. He seems to be speaking on behalf of his parent company. The existential threat—to the world and the audience—is already here.","'Captain America: Brave New World' was meant to put the MCU back on track.

As of February 17, it has been confirmed that all videos about Kim Sae Ron uploaded to 'Behind Master Lee Jin Ho' have been taken down. This is believed to be in response to growing criticism that excessive speculative reports and YouTube content contributed to Kim Sae Ron’s suicide.

Previously, reporter-turned-YouTuber Lee Jin Ho had produced multiple gossip-driven videos about the late Kim Sae Ron. One of these was about marriage rumors that surfaced in January.

On January 7, Lee Jin Ho speculated that Kim Sae Ron was preparing for marriage based on a social media post in which she wrote ""Marry"" alongside a photo of her in affectionate poses with a man.

When Lee Jin Ho attempted to contact Kim Sae Ron for clarification, he found that her number was unavailable. He then criticized her harshly, saying, ""It seems she even deleted her number due to the controversy. She lacks sincerity in her self-reflection and has no sense of responsibility as a celebrity.""

Lee Jin Ho also previously criticized Kim Sae Ron for allegedly drinking while on a self-imposed hiatus after her DUI incident. He questioned whether she was genuinely remorseful, although drinking itself is not an issue, only drinking and driving is. However, he framed the situation as if simply consuming alcohol was inherently wrong.

On February 17, Kwon Young Chan, head of the Korea Celebrity Suicide Prevention Association, who had met with Kim Sae Ron's father, pointed out an ""unnamed YouTuber"" during an interview. Kwon Young Chan stated, ""Kim Sae Ron's father said that his daughter suffered severe emotional distress due to YouTuber A’s videos.""

While the YouTuber was not explicitly named, considering that Lee Jin Ho continuously made speculative criticism about Kim Sae Ron, including ones regarding her wedding-themed photoshoot, and subsequently deleted all related videos, many believe Kwon Young Chan was referring to him.

Lee Jin Ho's channel has been flooded with angry comments demanding an apology. Netizens have left messages such as, ""Are you happy now that Kim Sae Ron is gone?,"" ""Cyberwrecker,"" ""You drove her to death,"" ""Deleting the videos is infuriating,"" and ""Murderer.""

Kwon Young Chan has since stated that if Kim Sae Ron’s family decides to take legal action against YouTuber 'A' or seek mediation through the Press Arbitration Commission, he will offer various forms of free support.

Meanwhile, Kim Sae Ron was found deceased in her Seoul home on February 16 at 4:54 PM. A friend who had planned to meet her discovered her and reported it to the police. Although no suicide note was found, authorities stated during a press briefing on February 17 that they believe she took her own life.

Meghan Markle’s Jam Business Has a New Name - The Cut,Meghan Markle has revamped her lifestyle brand-slash-jam company with a name that is both easier to say and less likely to get her into a patent dispute.,http://www.thecut.com/article/meghan-markle-new-as-ever-lifestyle-brand.html,entertainment,"Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage

Good-bye, American Riviera Orchard. We hardly knew ye. On Monday, Meghan Markle announced that the lifestyle brand she launched last year — which hasn’t done much except send jam to her friends — is getting a revamp. American Riviera Orchard is out, and As Ever is in. Is that a better name? It certainly sounds less like an actor’s diction exercise, so that’s a plus, and it’s far less likely to get her into a patent dispute.

“Last year, I had thought, ‘American Riviera, that sounds like such a great name.’ It’s my neighborhood; it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara, but it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area,” Markle said in an Instagram video, her new favorite way of communicating. The brand relaunch is being paired with the release of Markle’s Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, which comes out in March. Until then, you can bide your time by looking at Markle’s new website, which features nothing but a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, but is frankly much more inviting than the ARO one ever was.

“Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show, but as my partner in my business, which was huge,” Markle continued, “so I thought about it, and I’ve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022, and this is the moment, and it’s called As Ever.”

Markle promised that As Ever will feel familiar to anyone who kept up with her pre-Harry lifestyle blog, The Tig. “If you’ve followed me since 2014 with The Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening — this is what I do,” Markle explained, “I haven’t been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years, but now I can, so as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first.”

This is all very exciting, but one thing about Markle is that she cannot do anything without sending people into a tizzy. It turns out that there’s already a small New York–based clothing brand called As Ever. The brand’s founder, Mark Kolski, wrote on Instagram, “In the last 36 hours there has been an outpouring of support and concern regarding recent events around our namesake brand. We are aware. We are not affiliated.” Kolski’s As Ever has been around since 2015, and he wrote that it will continue on as ever.

Somehow, that wasn’t the only bit of controversy. The new name came with a new logo, which features a palm tree flanked by two hummingbirds. While tabloids speculate those are sweet symbolic nods to her relationship with Prince Harry, one Spanish official thinks Markle stole her town’s seal. “Page Six” reported that Xisca Mora, the mayor of a 5,000-person Mallorcan town called Porreres, is not so touched by Markle’s new logo. Despite the fact that there are some differences — the palm tree looks different, Porreres’s birds are swallows instead of hummingbirds — Mora is “studying the case with the legal services of the Consistory to see what course of action should be taken.” In layman’s terms, she’s deciding if she wants to sue. For once, I’d like to see something go off without a hitch for Markle.

On the positive side of things, Markle promised that her refreshed endeavor will still include fruit preserves. (“Jam is my jam.”) There will also be … other things? Markle remained vague about what the deal is going to be with As Ever but said, “There are so many more products that I just love, and now it’s time to share them with you.” What could that mean? We’ll find out when As Ever launches alongside Markle’s Netflix show in two weeks — but my guess is that it’s, like, scented candles.

Chinese scientists unveil potential game-changer in use of superconductors - South China Morning Post,It makes nickel just the third class of materials to achieve this feat above the threshold of minus 233 degrees Celsius at ‘normal’ pressure.,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3299254/chinese-scientists-create-new-superconducting-material-based-nickel,science,"Chinese physicists say they have created a new type of high-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure based on nickel – a breakthrough in the field.

It makes nickel just the third class of materials – after cuprates, or copper oxide-based materials, and iron-based materials – to achieve superconductivity above the threshold of minus 233 degrees Celsius (minus 387 Fahrenheit) at ambient or “normal” pressure, according to state media.

“Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature,” the researchers said in an early access manuscript published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature on February 17.

The team from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen said the finding could open up further research into the mechanisms behind superconductivity and applications.

Superconductivity is the phenomenon where a material has zero electrical resistance and repels magnetic fields when its temperature is lowered to a critical value.

Why ‘city-killer’ asteroid YR4’s impact probability keeps increasing - Big Think,"Asteroid 2024 YR4, which could devastate a city's worth of humans, has gone from 1.2% to 2.3% to 2.6% to 3.1% chances of impact. Here's why.",https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/city-killer-asteroid-yr4-impact-probability/,science,"Sign up for the Starts With a Bang newsletter Travel the universe with Dr. Ethan Siegel as he answers the biggest questions of all Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.

On December 27, 2024, a very small, fast-moving asteroid was found in the vicinity of Earth. Dubbed 2024 YR4, or YR4 for short, it’s approximately 50 meters in diameter, weighs somewhere around 200,000 tons, and made its most recent, closest approach to Earth just two days prior: on December 25, 2024. In the time since its discovery, many observatories have monitored its motion, enabling us to reconstruct its orbit to a fairly good level of precision. We know it orbits the Sun with a period of around 4 years, achieving a maximum distance from the Sun of around 4.18 astronomical units, or right at the outer edge of the asteroid belt. It will make its next close approach to Earth (but will definitively miss us) on December 17, 2028, and then have a second, potentially hazardous encounter with us four years later: on December 22, 2032.

The best data we have indicates that the asteroid will miss us in 2032 by a slim margin: just 160,000 kilometers, or less than half of the distance from the Earth to the Moon. However, our data is still highly uncertain, with a (99.7% confidence) region that spans 1.28 million kilometers across: a region that still definitively includes planet Earth, itself just ~12,750 km in diameter. Since its discovery, the reported odds of an impact with our planet have continued to increase: from 1.2%, initially, to 2.3%, then to 2.6%, and, as of February 18, now 3.1%.

Does this mean we’re at a severe risk of an impact? Not at all. We can expect the probability to continue to increase for a time, and then, all at once, plummet to zero. Here’s the science of why that’s the most likely outcome, plus what humanity’s recourse should be if we get unlucky enough so that an impact becomes inevitable.

This diagram shows the Torino scale, with numbers 0-10, and the evolution from December 2024 to February 2025 (with black arrow) of potentially hazardous asteroid 2024 YR4. The probability of impact increases as the uncertainty in its trajectory decreases, but will suddenly plummet toward 0 if it is determined that the object will miss the Earth. Credit: NASA

What you see, above, is known as the Torino scale: the scale for measuring the potential hazards of an object in space that might strike the Earth. You’ll notice that the chart is divided up in a way that only some objects have any hazard rating at all. An object that will definitely miss us is Level 0; an object smaller than 20 meters in diameter is also Level 0, as even if it strikes us, the maximum amount of damage it could cause would be comparable to the Chelyabinsk impactor of 2013, which only resulted in minor injuries arising from broken glass that shattered during the asteroid’s impact.

Larger bodies do pose a danger, with objects between 20-100 meters falling into the “city-killer” range, objects between 100 meters and 1 kilometer falling into the “regional devastation” category, and with objects greater than 1 kilometer representing an “extinction-level” threat. The greater the probability of impact, the higher the cause for alarm. However, even with all the recent attention given to asteroid YR4, it only ranks a “3” on this scale at present. According to NASA, an object with a Torino scale rating of 3 should be thought of as follows:

“A close encounter, meriting attention by astronomers. Current calculations give a 1% or greater chance of collision capable of localized destruction. Most likely, new telescopic observations will lead to re-assignment to Level 0. Attention by public and by public officials is merited if the encounter is less than a decade away.”

It’s no stretch to claim that YR4 is the most hazardous object yet identified since the invention of the Torino scale, and yet, it’s still very unlikely to pose any threat to Earth at all. NASA knows this, as you can see in its assertion that, “Most likely, new telescopic observations will lead to re-assignment to Level 0.” However, this both hasn’t been made clear in news reports and the reasons behind why this is the case are almost never discussed. Let’s fix that right now by going through the science of how we calculate orbital trajectories and, along with those calculations, estimate the uncertainties that come along with them.

When you first identify an object through a telescope, there are a lot of things you can observe about it.

You can determine where it is and when, at least, on a two-dimensional projection of the sky.

You can track its motion over time, giving you a series of points-in-time that allow you to determine its motion.

You can use what’s theoretically known about the law of gravity to infer its past and future trajectory as well.

You can fold in the uncertainties that arise owing to the imperfect nature of your tools and measuring devices, projecting that forward to future uncertainties in its orbital path.

And, presuming you know enough about the positions and motions of other gravitationally important bodies in/near its path, including the Sun and the major planets, you can calculate how those trajectories might deviate from a purely Keplerian one in the future.

The devastation that would be caused by an impact from 2024 YR4 is presently wildly uncertain. Credit: Sinucep/Wikimedia Commons

The more observations you can take of the object — including with better tools, to greater precisions, and over longer baselines of time — the smaller your uncertainties will get, and the more confident you’ll be in your predictions for the object’s future trajectory. On the other hand, when you have fewer observations, including observations that are only acquired over a short period of time or a small fraction of the object’s orbit, your uncertainties will tend to be large.

In general, the best time to observe an object, at least, if your goal is to fully determine its orbital trajectory, is when it’s moving rapidly across the sky: i.e., when it’s close to perihelion, or its closest approach to the Sun. For an object way out in the Kuiper belt, it might take several years of observations to determine a reliable orbit; for an object that’s much closer to us, such as in the inner Solar System, we can do much better with only a few weeks or a couple of months of observations.

Because we only discovered 2024 YR4 in late December of 2024, well after its (November 22nd) perihelion, we’re only able to project its trajectory to within a specific precision at present. Although the best fit estimate to its trajectory indicates that it will miss Earth by ~160,000 km, there’s an uncertainty in that trajectory, primarily in one specific spatial dimension, of ±213,811 km.

This diagram shows the possible paths (red dots) of asteroid 2024 YR4 relative to Earth and the Moon’s orbit, as illustrated by the density of the dots. The most likely scenario is that the asteroid misses Earth and the Moon, with (at present) a 3.1% chance of it striking the Earth and an 0.3% chance of it striking the Moon. The most likely event is no collision at all. Credit: ESA/Planetary Defence Office

Think about what that means for a moment. It means that, based on what we know about this object, the best reconstructed orbital trajectory that we can infer for it implies that it will miss Earth by ~160,000 kilometers: about 12.5 Earth diameters. If we know this trajectory to a precision of ±10,000 km, then we could be completely certain it would miss us; it would take an outlier event of more than a 15-sigma (15 one-sided standard deviations) to lead to a collision, something with negligible (~0) probability.

However, if we only knew this trajectory to a precision of ±40,000 km, we would think it’s likely that this object would miss us, but we’d want better data so that we could exclude a collision at higher significance. In physics and astronomy, that precision (of about 3.8-sigma) only excludes a collision at about the 99.98% level; we would like to be more precise.

With today’s best data — that is, as of February 18, 2025 — our uncertainty on 2024 YR4 is unacceptably large, as this trajectory is only known to a precision of ±213,811 km. We’ll need, realistically, to determine its orbit to a precision that’s about seven times better in order to safely rule out the possibility of an impact.

This animation shows four years of asteroid 2024 YR4’s orbits with respect to the orbits of the inner four planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. In December of 2028, the asteroid will pass relatively close to Earth, but will miss our planet substantially. Four years later, on December 22, 2032, a potential impact may yet occur.

However, we’re in a lousy predicament right now, at least, in terms of the quality of the data we have. When it comes to statistical significance, anytime you see the “±” symbol, followed by a number, you need to ask yourself, “What type of uncertainty is this?” The uncertainty in the trajectory of 2024 YR4, as it’s being widely reported, is ±641,435 km, but that’s a 3-sigma uncertainty, not the standard 1-sigma that corresponds to ±213,811 km. The way statistics works, assuming your only measurement uncertainties are statistical in nature, tells us that:

there’s a ~68% chance that the “true value” lies within 1-sigma of the most likely value,

a ~95% chance that the “true value” lies within 2-sigma of the most likely value,

a ~99.7% chance that the “true value” lies within 3-sigma of the most likely value,

a ~99.99% chance that the “true value” lies within 4-sigma of the most likely value,

and so on.

Because the most likely value is “only” 160,000 km away from Earth, that means that lowering the uncertainty to below its current value of ±213,811 km is going to:

increase the probability of impact as the uncertainty is lowered, ruling out the “misses Earth by a lot” scenarios,

until the uncertainty gets significantly smaller than the “most likely value,”

and then the probability of impact will drop exponentially,

as we will then be able to predict its trajectory more robustly and with smaller errors.

Barringer Crater, also known as Meteor Crater, is an impressive crater located in the Arizona desert, more than a mile in diameter. Although this crater was made tens of thousands of years ago, it was caused by a relatively small impactor estimated at a mere 50-100 meters across: less than a third the size of asteroid Dimorphos, the asteroid that NASA’s DART mission collided with. Although these “city-killer” sized objects are dangerous, the damage they cause remains localized, unlike for larger impact events. Credit: Grahampurse/Wikimedia Commons

This has been precisely the scenario that’s arisen for practically every asteroid ever discovered and tracked, and is very, very likely (with still 96%+ probability) going to apply to 2024 YR4. The prior “record” for most likely terrestrial impact by an identified body went to asteroid Apophis, which was deemed to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth back in 2004, when it was first discovered. Subsequent measurements better determined its trajectory, and its current risk of impact is deemed at odds much lower than 1-in-a-million. However, until we can reach that level of precision in our measurements for 2024 YR4 — which will likely require observations from the world’s most powerful telescopes, potentially including even JWST — we have to keep ourselves open to the possibility that it may yet strike us.

That possibility makes measuring its trajectory (as well as its other properties) to an incredibly high precision all the more important. 2024 YR4, for example:

could still strike Earth, or it could miss us by hundreds of thousands of kilometers,

could be as small as just 40 meters across, or as large as ~90 meters across,

could have as little kinetic energy as a few hundred kilotons of TNT, or as much as 15 megatons of TNT.

That last uncertainty, arising largely from its uncertainty in overall mass (as we know it will move at around 17 km/s if it strikes Earth in 2032) is the difference between a Chelyabinsk-scale impact, which killed no one, and the type of impact that created Barringer Crater (also known as Meteor Crater) in Arizona, which could kill hundreds of thousands or more if it struck a large city.

And there are, indeed, plenty of large cities in the potential path of 2024 YR4 that could experience dire consequences, including Bogotá, Columbia, Lagos, Nigeria, Sana’a, Yemen, Mumbai, India, and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Even in the event of an oceanic strike, the potential for coastal flooding and tsunami events means there are potentially billions or even trillions of dollars worth of property damage that could occur. If it were determined that 2024 YR4 was indeed at risk of striking Earth — something that should be easy to determine with high-quality data that ought to be acquired over the next few weeks and months — then our best recourse would be to leverage what we learned from the DART mission to redirect an asteroid, and get to work on planning for asteroid deflection of 2024 YR4.

What would that look like?

If you want to redirect a large, massive body in space, you need to course-correct as early as possible. When you’re on the highway and notice your vehicle slightly drifting toward one edge of your lane, you slightly adjust the steering wheel well ahead of time, otherwise you’ll be required to make a larger, more dynamic maneuver if you wait until the last minute. In the case of asteroid deflection, redirecting it would involve a blast or collision: imparting kinetic energy to it in an effort to change its motion. The longer you wait, and the closer the “redirect” time is to the impact time, the more energetic your efforts will need to be.

This diagram shows the orbit of the four inner terrestrial planets of our Solar System, along with the inferred orbital trajectory of asteroid 2024 YR4, as determined on January 28, 2025. After another close pass by Earth in December of 2028, asteroid 2024 YR4 will spend another four years in orbit before either making an extremely close pass by Earth or striking it on December 22, 2032. Any redirection efforts will benefit from a maximal amount of lead time. Credit: NASA/JPL

There are a few things that determine how much energy you’d need to successfully redirect an asteroid like 2024 YR4. For one, you need to know how much time you have until impact, and for us, that’s until December 22, 2032. Our next best opportunity for redirection will occur about four years prior: on December 17, 2028, when 2024 YR4 makes another (relatively) close pass of Earth. Because Earth has a mean radius of 6371 km, we’ll need to deflect the asteroid by at least that much, and in order to change a massive object’s momentum, you need a massive (or energetic) impact to it that’s capable of sufficiently changing its motion, which depends on asteroid 2024 YR4’s overall mass.

That last figure is greatly uncertain: it’s estimated at 220,000 tonnes (2.2 × 108 kg), but that’s uncertain by approximately a factor of 10. Missions like NASA’s DART or Deep Impact missions had masses of a few hundred kilograms, and can have relative speeds with respect to an asteroid that are significant: around ~10 km/s or potentially even a little more. If we’re generous, and assume:

a spacecraft mass of 1000 kg,

a relative speed of 20 km/s,

a mass for 2024 YR4 of the anticipated 2.2 × 10 8 kg,

kg, a redirect attempt in 2028, four years in advance of the potential impact,

and also assume a perfectly elastic collision between the spacecraft and the asteroid,

we could change the asteroid’s speed by about 18 centimeters-per-second. After four years, that could change the path of 2024 YR4 by up to 22,000 km: more than the full diameter of Earth.

This Hubble Space Telescope image from October 8, 2022, shows the debris emanating from asteroid Dimorphos just under 12 full days after it was impacted, on purpose, by NASA’s DART spacecraft. The debris tail changes rapidly over time, but the larger effect is the overall redirected orbit of Dimorphos, which was measured and is substantial. Credit: NASA/ESA/STScI/Hubble

Yes, there would be potential risks if we did attempt to redirect the asteroid with an impact. The asteroid could fragment, leading to a long, distended trail of debris that struck Earth. The impactor could become embedded, nudging the asteroid but failing to cause it to miss Earth. Or we could choose a worse strategy than an impactor, such as detonating a nuclear device on or near the asteroid, which could simultaneously fail to sufficiently change its course while imparting it with radioactive, potentially deadly isotopes. The optimal strategy for redirection remains to impact the asteroid, in the proper direction, at the maximum speed with the maximum mass spacecraft with as much time in advance of the potential impact with Earth as possible.

However, it’s unlikely that such a redirect mission will be required. Anything can pose a “risk of impact” if you’re bad enough at measuring it, and right now, the small, fast-moving nature of 2024 YR4 coupled with the brief window of observations we’ve acquired means that we’re sufficiently bad at measuring it that we do not know whether it will strike us or not. The odds are against it, but it will take better observations — observations which should be forthcoming — to know for sure. In all probability, the “odds of impact” will soon peak at around ~5%, and then plummet thereafter. But until we collect the critical data, we can’t know for sure. If we want to truly know what’s coming for us out there in the Universe, high-precision observations for the purpose of planetary defense are the most informative intervention we can take at present.","Asteroid 2024 YR4 was found in the vicinity of Earth on December 27, 2024. It’s approximately 50 meters in diameter, weighs somewhere around 200,000 tons. It will make its next close approach to Earth (but will definitively miss us) on December 17, 2028."
Scientists Put a Human Language Gene Into Mice And Changed Their Voice - ScienceAlert,A new contender for a human 'language gene' can change the way that mice squeak when it is incorporated into their DNA.,https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-put-a-human-language-gene-into-mice-and-changed-their-voice,science,"A new contender for a human 'language gene' can change the way that mice squeak when it is incorporated into their DNA.

The gene is called NOVA1, and in our own species, it is remarkably unique. While virtually all other mammals have the same NOVA1 variant in their genetic code, a single change of an amino acid is seen in the human version.

This one, subtle tweak may have played a critical role in the origins of spoken language and the expansion and survival of Homo sapiens, according to researchers at Rockefeller University and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.

Not even Neanderthals and Denisovans have the same variant, which means it must have evolved in the last few hundred thousand years, after our species split from these extinct relatives.

Other proposed 'language genes', like FOXP2, which also make mice squeak differently are found in the DNA of Neanderthals. So even though they probably also contributed to the origins of human language, they may not be responsible for our more recent evolutionary success.

It's not clear what the language capabilities of our extinct relatives once were, but this recent change has proved highly successful in the human genome.

In more than 650,000 human DNA sequences, researchers found only six anonymous people who did not have the modern NOVA1 variant. Nothing about these individuals is known.

When it comes to the origins of complex human language, NOVA1 is ""the new kid on the block"", geneticist Wolfgang Enard who worked on the FOXP2 gene told Carl Zimmer at The New York Times.

""This gene is part of a sweeping evolutionary change in early modern humans and hints at potential ancient origins of spoken language,"" says neuro-oncologist Robert Darnell from Rockefeller University, who has been studying the gene and its links to disease and intellectual function since the early 1990s.

""NOVA1 may be a bona fide human 'language gene,' though certainly it's only one of many human-specific genetic changes.""

When Darnell and his team artificially generated the human variant of NOVA1 in mice, they found that the rodents squeaked differently. Adults and pups still made the same amount of noise, but their vocalization patterns had changed.

Compared to typical mice, genetically modified pups made higher-frequency ultrasonic squeaks. Their calls didn't get their mother's attention any more than the calls of a control pup, but these sounds may indicate an increased attempt at social interaction, albeit a failed one.

Higher frequency calls are also used by adult male mice during courtship for similar reasons. When adult male mice were genetically altered with the human NOVA1 variant, their squeaks during courtship didn't become higher pitched like the pups. Instead, their vocalizations included more complex syllables.

""They 'talked' differently to the female mice,"" explains Darnell. ""One can imagine how such changes in vocalization could have a profound impact on evolution.""

Why the mice sound different with the human NOVA1 variant is a mystery that Darnell and his colleagues are keen to solve. The team suspects that the human variant is causing molecular shifts in some parts of the developing rodent brain – whether it be the vocal pathways of the midbrain and brainstem or more recently evolved regions in the cortex, which control pitch and frequency.

The NOVA1 gene is known as a 'master gene regulator' because it influences more than 90 percent of other human genes during development.

NOVA1 encodes a protein called Nova-1 that can cut out and rearrange sections of messenger RNA when it binds to neurons. This changes how brain cells synthesize proteins, probably creating molecular diversity in the central nervous system.

When Darnell and his team 'humanized' mice with the NOVA1 variant, they found molecular changes in the RNA splicing seen in brain cells, especially in regions associated with vocal behavior.

""We thought, wow. We did not expect that,"" Darnell says. ""It was one of those really surprising moments in science.""

For Darnell, understanding NOVA1 has been a career-long effort.

NOVA1 is thought to help regulate learning in humans, and mutations in this gene can cause severe psychiatric disorders and abnormalities in motor development.

Its role in speech development is just starting to emerge, and while much remains hypothetical, the possibilities are profound.

""Our data show that an ancestral population of modern humans in Africa evolved the human variant I197V, which then became dominant, perhaps because it conferred advantages related to vocal communication,"" suggests Darnell.

""This population then left Africa and spread across the world.""

No doubt having a chat on the way.

The study was published in Nature Communications.","The gene is called NOVA1, and in our own species, it is remarkably unique. Not even Neanderthals and Denisovans have the same variant. It must have evolved in the last few hundred thousand years, after our species split from these extinct relatives."

'Missing' Planet to Join a Rare Cosmic Lineup This Week - ScienceAlert,One planet was missing from the sunset lineup… until now.,https://www.sciencealert.com/missing-planet-to-join-a-rare-cosmic-lineup-this-week,science,"One planet was missing from the sunset lineup… until now.

Perhaps you've seen the news headlines admonishing sky watchers to 'See All Naked Eye Planets … at Once!' in January. While this was basically true, it was also missing one key player: Mercury.

This week, the swift inner planet joins the scene at dusk.

It's certainly rare to see all the planets in the Solar System in one sweep. This sort of lineup depends mainly on slow moving Jupiter and Saturn, which have parted ways since the rare conjunction of the two on December 21st, 2020.

A Planetary Dusk Tour

Seeing all the naked eye planets at once is set to become a rarity in coming years.

In any event, here's a tour of the planets at dusk for the remainder of February into early March from the inner Solar System outward, with ready-made star party facts for each:

Fresh off solar conjunction on February 9th, the vigil is now on the week to recover Mercury low to the west after sunset. If you've never crossed elusive Mercury off of your astronomical 'life list,' now is the time to try, using brilliant Venus as a guide.

Mercury passes 1.5 degrees north of Saturn on February 25th, and the waxing crescent Moon joins the scene on February 28th, and occults Mercury on March 1st for Hawai'i and the Pacific.

Though the oft-told tale that astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus never saw Mercury is probably apocryphal, it does speak to just how elusive the fleeting world is. Mercury reaches greatest elongation for the first of six times in 2025 on March 8th, 18 degrees east of the Sun shining at magnitude -0.35 and displaying a half illuminated disk in the telescope, just 7″ across.

The crescent Moon then passes 5.7 degrees south of Venus on March 2nd, marking a good time to see the two in the daytime. Fun fact this President's Day week: attendants of Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4th 1865 actually noticed the Venus in the daytime sky as the midday clouds cleared.

A Planetary Race

Venus and Mercury both go on to race each other towards inferior conjunction next month, passing the Sun just 24 hours apart on March 23 and 24th. Both will then reemerge into the dawn sky in late March.

Spotting Venus through inferior conjunction is tricky but not impossible, as the -4.2 magnitude slender 1% crescent passes just over 8 degrees north of the Sun at its closest. Be sure to try this feat visual athletics before sunrise, or after sunset.

Into the Outer Solar System

Mars leads up the back of the pack, shining at -0.58 magnitude in Gemini the Twins. Look for ruddy Mars high to the east at dusk, fresh off of opposition on January 16th. The waxing gibbous Moon meets up with Mars on March 9th. NASA's ESCAPADE Mars mission is set to launch for the Red Planet this year.

Onward and outward, Jupiter rides high to the south in Taurus the Bull at dusk. The waxing near First Quarter Moon meets Jupiter on March 6th, and the planet reaches quadrature 90 degrees east) of the Sun on March 2nd.

Danish astronomer Ole Rømer noticed that predictions for phenomena for Jupiter's moons (transits, ingress/egress times, etc) were off from opposition versus quadrature, and correctly deduced it was because the time it took light to traverse the two different distances was not factored in.

Sometimes, scientific inspiration doesn't stem as much from a 'eureka!' moment, but simply from a patient observer saying 'that's funny…'

Meanwhile, the outermost of the classical planets presents a challenge, as Saturn sits in the murk low to the west.

Once you've found Mercury, sweep the horizon with binoculars and scoop up +1.1 magnitude Saturn, just over three times fainter than Mercury. The rings of Saturn pass edge on as seen from our Earthly vantage point on March 23rd, just two weeks after solar conjunction.

…And Something More

Finally, completists will want to also pick off the outer ice giant worlds Uranus and Neptune. +5.8 magnitude Uranus is an easy binocular catch in Taurus (not far from Jupiter), while +7.8 magnitude Neptune is more of a challenge, hanging out in the murk low to the horizon with Mercury and Saturn in Pisces the Fishes.

Both planets have the distinction of being discovered in the telescopic era, and Neptune is the only planet discovered using the power of math and deduction.

The celestial drama sorts itself out in March, with Saturn leaving the scene and Mercury and Venus reappearing in the dawn sky.

But hey, we have the first of two eclipse seasons for 2025 coming right up next month, with a partial solar eclipse on March 29th and a total lunar eclipse on 14th.

Let's hope that the fickle Spring weather cooperates. Good skywatching, and clear skies in your planetary quest.

Extreme Drop in Oxygen Will Eventually Suffocate Most Life on Earth - ScienceAlert,"For now, life is flourishing on our oxygen-rich planet, but Earth wasn't always that way – and scientists have predicted that, in the future, the atmosphere will revert back to one that's rich in methane and low in oxygen.",https://www.sciencealert.com/extreme-drop-in-oxygen-will-eventually-suffocate-most-life-on-earth,science,"For now, life is flourishing on our oxygen-rich planet, but Earth wasn't always that way – and scientists have predicted that, in the future, the atmosphere will revert back to one that's rich in methane and low in oxygen.

This probably won't happen for another billion years or so. But when the change comes, it's going to happen fairly rapidly, according to research published in 2021.

This shift will take the planet back to something like the state it was in before what's known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) around 2.4 billion years ago.

""For many years, the lifespan of Earth's biosphere has been discussed based on scientific knowledge about the steadily brightening of the sun and global carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle,"" environmental scientist Kazumi Ozaki from Toho University in Japan said when the study was published.

""One of the corollaries of such a theoretical framework is a continuous decline in atmospheric CO 2 levels and global warming on geological timescales.""

The researchers say that atmospheric oxygen is unlikely to be a permanent feature of habitable worlds in general, which has implications for our efforts to detect signs of life further out in the Universe.

""The model projects that a deoxygenation of the atmosphere, with atmospheric O 2 dropping sharply to levels reminiscent of the Archaean Earth, will most probably be triggered before the inception of moist greenhouse conditions in Earth's climate system and before the extensive loss of surface water from the atmosphere,"" the team explained in their paper.

At that point it'll be the end of the road for human beings and most other life forms that rely on oxygen to get through the day, so let's hope we figure out how to get off the planet at some point within the next billion years.

To reach their conclusions, the researchers ran detailed models of Earth's biosphere, factoring in changes in the brightness of the Sun and the corresponding drop in carbon dioxide levels, as the gas gets broken down by increasing levels of heat.

Less carbon dioxide means fewer photosynthesizing organisms such as plants, which would result in less oxygen.

Scientists have previously predicted that increased radiation from the Sun would wipe ocean waters off the face of our planet within about 2 billion years, but the model here – based on an average of just under 400,000 simulations – says the reduction in oxygen is going to kill off life first.

""The drop in oxygen is very, very extreme,"" Earth scientist Chris Reinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, told New Scientist. ""We're talking around a million times less oxygen than there is today.""

What makes the study particularly relevant to the present day is our search for habitable planets outside of the Solar System.

Increasingly powerful telescopes are coming online, and scientists want to be able to know what they should be looking for in the reams of data these instruments are collecting.

It's possible that we need to be hunting for other biosignatures besides oxygen to have the best chance of spotting life, the researchers say. Their study was part of the NASA NExSS (Nexus for Exoplanet System Science) project, which is investigating the habitability of planets other than our own.

According to the calculations run by Ozaki and Reinhard, the oxygen-rich habitable history of Earth could end up lasting for just 20-30 percent of the planet's lifespan as a whole – and microbial life will carry on existing long after we are gone.

""The atmosphere after the great deoxygenation is characterized by an elevated methane, low-levels of CO 2 , and no ozone layer,"" said Ozaki.

""The Earth system will probably be a world of anaerobic life forms.""

The research was published in Nature Geoscience.

An earlier version of this article was published in March 2021.","Scientists predict that Earth's atmosphere will revert back to one that's rich in methane and low in oxygen. This probably won't happen for another billion years or so. But when the change comes, it's going to happen fairly rapidly."
Blood moon 2025: How to see the moon turn red over North America during March's total lunar eclipse - Livescience.com,"Here's everything you need to know about how to see the first ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse since 2022, and the only one visible from North America this year, when it rises in March.",https://www.livescience.com/space/the-moon/blood-moon-2025-how-to-see-the-moon-turn-red-over-north-america-during-marchs-total-lunar-eclipse,science,"A total lunar eclipse is coming to Earth for the first time since 2022. On the night of March 13-14, 2025, North America and South America will get a great view of all phases of what is commonly called a ""blood moon.""

During the total lunar eclipse, which will last about five hours, the full moon will travel through Earth's shadow and take on a striking reddish hue for 65 minutes. Unlike a total solar eclipse , which can be seen only from within a narrow path of totality, a total lunar eclipse is visible from anywhere on Earth's night side. Overnight on March 13-14, that will include all North American time zones, including Alaska and Hawaii. Observers in Western Europe will see the moon set while still eclipsed, while in Australia and New Zealand, it will rise already in totality. (Totality refers to the period when a celestial object is fully eclipsed, as seen from Earth.)

A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth is positioned directly between the sun and a full moon, causing the planet's darkest shadow, its umbra, to cover the lunar surface. The moon turns red because the only light reaching it is sunlight refracted through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out shorter wavelengths and leaves behind only long-wavelength, reddish hues. The physics is similar to what happens during sunrise and sunset.

""Blood moon"": Phases of a lunar eclipse

The lunar eclipse will happen in five stages between 11:57 p.m. and 6 a.m. EDT (03:57 to 10:00 UTC), according to Timeanddate.com . The first stage begins when the moon moves into Earth's fuzzy outer shadow, its penumbra, and loses its brightness. It then enters the umbra, and gradually turns reddish as the line of Earth's shadow moves across the moon.

Totality is the phase you don't want to miss — when the entire lunar surface will appear reddish, becoming a true ""blood moon."" Halfway through that 65-minute period, the event starts to run in reverse, with the moon gradually slipping out of Earth's umbra, then penumbra, before finally returning to its regular bright, white-gray color.

For those in eastern areas of North America, the initial partial phase of the eclipse will begin at 1:09 a.m. EDT on March 14, with totality lasting from 2:26 a.m. to 3:32 a.m. EDT. On the West Coast, the partial phase starts at 10:09 p.m. PDT on March 13, with totality occurring from 11:26 p.m. to 12:32 a.m. PDT on March 14. Because lunar eclipses are global events that occur at the same moment worldwide, these differences are merely due to time zones.

Japan's Resilience moon lander aces lunar flyby ahead of historic touchdown try (photo) - Space.com,"Resilience came within 5,220 miles (8,400 kilometers) of the lunar surface on Feb. 14.",https://www.space.com/japan-ispace-resilience-moon-lander-aces-flyby-ahead-of-touchdown,science,"Resilience, a lunar lander built by Japanese company ispace, snapped this photo of the moon during a close flyby on Feb. 15, 2025.

The private Resilience lunar lander just got its first up-close look at the moon.

Resilience, which was built by Japanese company ispace, aced a flyby of the moon on Friday evening (Feb. 14), coming within a mere 5,220 miles (8,400 kilometers) of Earth's nearest neighbor.

The lander memorialized the milestone with a photo, snapping a nice shot of the battered lunar surface from a distance of 8,972 miles (14,439 km).

The close encounter was ""a historic first of its type for a Japanese private, commercial lunar lander,"" according to ispace. It gave Resilience a fuel-saving gravity assist, changing the lander's trajectory in a way that will make its arrival in lunar orbit, which is expected in early May, more energy-efficient.

Resilience launched on Jan. 15 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which also carried a second private moon lander — Blue Ghost, built and operated by Texas-based Firefly Aerospace.

Blue Ghost is already circling the moon. It arrived on Thursday (Feb. 13), then lowered its orbit around Earth's nearest neighbor with an engine burn just this morning (Feb. 18).

Blue Ghost, Firefly's first-ever lunar lander, is gearing up for a touchdown attempt two weeks from now. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will land March 2 in Mare Crisium (""Sea of Crises""), a large volcanic basin on the moon's near side.

Resilience, meanwhile, will target Mare Frigoris (""Sea of Cold""), in the moon's northern hemisphere; touchdown is expected in late May or early June. The lander is carrying five science and technology payloads, including a mini rover named Tenacious, which was built by ispace's Luxembourg-based subsidiary.

None of this gear was built by NASA. Blue Ghost, by contrast, is carrying 10 agency experiments; the American lander's mission is supported by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, which aims to gather lunar data ahead of the arrival of Artemis astronauts later this decade.

Resilience is ispace's second moon lander. The first reached lunar orbit successfully in March 2023 but failed during its touchdown try a month later after getting confused by the rim of a lunar crater.","Resilience, a lunar lander, snapped a photo of the moon during a close flyby on Feb. 15, 2025.

Is Pluto a planet or not? Who cares! Our love for the King of the Kuiper Belt is stronger than ever 95 years later - Space.com,"The controversy endures over Pluto's true status, but the solar system underdog continues to capture hearts across the globe.",https://www.space.com/the-universe/pluto/is-pluto-a-planet-or-not-who-cares-our-love-for-the-king-of-the-kuiper-belt-is-stronger-than-ever-95-years-later,science,"Clyde Tombaugh didn't set out to discover Pluto when he sent his sketches of the night sky to Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1929. More than anything, he just wanted to get off the farm in Kansas where he spent his days working the earth.

At just 23 years old, Tombaugh sent his drawings, unsolicited, to several institutions and observatories around the United States, hoping someone — anyone — would give him some feedback on what he'd produced.

The response from Lowell Observatory, then, must have been a shock when it hit his mailbox. It was more than a critique of his drawings from professional astronomers. Instead, it was a job offer (from the head of the Observatory, no less), and one that within two years would put Tombaugh in an elite and narrow pantheon of stargazers who could claim what only the ancients could boast: the discovery of a new planet.

The search for Planet X

The search for Pluto did not begin with Clyde Tombaugh, to be fair. That distinction belongs to the visionary astronomer Percival Lowell .

In 1894, Lowell founded Lowell Observatory in the Arizona territory (Arizona wouldn't become a state until 1912). Originally a scion of an elite Boston family, Lowell became fascinated with the study of Mars and its purported canals . With family wealth to back him, he founded an observatory in the western dark-sky desert of the U.S. and hoped to unlock the mystery of the Red Planet.

He soon became fascinated by another cosmic mystery, however, and one that would be far more consequential. Uranus and Neptune, the most recently discovered planets in the solar system at the time, seemed out of sorts. Their orbits didn't add up mathematically, and Lowell was convinced there was an undiscovered planet in the far reaches of the solar system that was knocking them off-kilter.

""Lowell wanted to learn more about the planets and started coming under the belief that there might be a ninth planet out there,” Kevin Schindler, Lowell Observatory’s Public Information Officer, told Space.com. ""That was based on some irregular motions, or apparent irregular motions, of [Uranus and Neptune].""

He called this hypothetical world ""Planet X.""

""In some ways, Pluto's more of a planet than some of the other established planets, like Mercury."" Kevin Schindler, Lowell Observatory's Public Information Officer.

Lowell dedicated years to predicting the location of this elusive planet. He and his team at the observatory came up with calculations for the world's path and location, but by the time of his death in 1916, the planet (like most other hypothetical worlds), failed to materialize.

With many in the scientific community convinced that there were no more planets to discover, the search for Planet X was abandoned soon after Lowell's death.

The self-taught astronomer

Clyde Tombaugh 's journey to planetary discovery is one of the most remarkable in the history of astronomy. Born in 1906 in Illinois and raised on a farm in Burnett, Kansas, Tombaugh had a deep fascination with the night sky. With little formal training, he built his own telescopes and meticulously sketched astronomical observations out in Kansas's dark-sky country.

""Tombaugh sent some of his drawings off to different places, including Lowell Observatory, and he got this letter back from the director saying, 'We're just recommencing the search for a ninth planet, and we need somebody to help with it. It looks like you know what you're talking about, so why don’t you come work for us?'"" Schindler said. ""He got a one-way bus ticket, hoping that he wouldn't have to go back home in a short time, and started working at the observatory.""

Tombaugh arrived in 1929 hoping to prove himself, but his job was painstaking compared to sketching the night sky in Kansas. Using a technique called "" blink comparison ,"" Tombaugh searched through countless, and nearly identical, photographic plates for the elusive planet.

Blink comparison involves looking at photographs of the same portion of the sky on different nights and then rapidly switching between the two images to spot any moving objects. Because far-off stars would be static over successive nights, nearer, moving objects would stand out against the backdrop — but, for an object as distant as Pluto, the motion would be barely perceptible.

It took months of tedious work, flipping back and forth between effectively identical photographic plates, but on February 18, 1930, Tombaugh finally found what he was looking for: a tiny moving speck against the starry background, roughly where Lowell had predicted it would be.

A ninth planet, Pluto, had been discovered.

An ironic discovery

One of the most fascinating aspects of Pluto's discovery is that it was, in part, a cosmic coincidence.

""Pluto was found really close to where Lowell thought a planet should be, but it's also a great example of serendipity in science,"" Schindler said. ""When Lowell was doing his work, there was an estimate of what Uranus' and Neptune's masses were, but they weren't very accurate. Today, we have much more accurate estimates and we know that the irregular motions [that led to the prediction of a Planet X] actually don't exist. If you know the true value of the masses of Uranus and Neptune, everything's accounted for.”

In other words, Pluto showing up in Tombaugh’s photos where it did wasn’t the result of careful calculation, but rather a good bit of dumb luck.

""Clyde Tombaugh was looking for a phantom,"" Schindler said, ""but he found a planet. It was just coincidence that it was right where Lowell thought it should be.""

Pluto's cultural impact

Lucky find or not, the discovery of Pluto came at a crucial moment in history, particularly for the U.S. By 1930, the Great Depression had left much of the world in economic ruin, and scientific breakthroughs provided a much-needed source of inspiration.

""It had such a cultural impact because we were in the Depression, and there wasn't much good news in the newspaper,"" Schindler said. ""It was a good news story in a time of otherwise pretty lousy news.""

Pluto's discovery was widely celebrated, especially in the U.S. After all, it was the first planet discovered in the new world, and America needed the win in 1930.

""I think because it was discovered by the United States and also discovered in the 20th century with mass media, it has a lot of fascination,"" Schindler said. ""For decades, Pluto was seen as the ninth planet of the solar system, an underdog among its much larger planetary siblings of the inner planets and the gas giants beyond the asteroid belt.""

However, as scientific understanding evolved, so did Pluto's classification — though not without controversy.

The reclassification of Pluto

In 2006, Pluto's planetary status was re-evaluated by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), leading to its reclassification as a ""dwarf planet."" The change was based on new criteria for defining planets. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet must:

1. Orbit the sun

2. Be massive to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., be a spheroid under the force of its own gravity)

3. Clear its orbit of other debris

Pluto fails the third criterion because its orbit overlaps with objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. So, a new class of celestial object — the dwarf planet — came into being, with Pluto at its head.

This decision sparked widespread debate, both among the public and among many astronomers.

""There's this perception that Pluto got dumped,"" Schindler said. ""So many people took that personally, and we would have guests come to the [Lowell] Observatory saying things like, 'Are you guys okay?'""

Part of the problem with the reclassification, pioneered by Caltech astronomer Michael Brown and supported by other prominent astronomers like the Hayden Planetarium’s Neil deGrasse Tyson , is that until the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet, no one had really bothered to define what a planet actually was.

""I think [the 2006 reclassification] was a starting point,"" Schindler said. ""It's not a bad thing to have a definition of what a planet is, but it's not really the best definition. It has problems. I think one of the issues [fueling the controversy] is, if scientists are confused about the definition, what's the rest of the public supposed to do? How are we supposed to understand what a planet is, if scientists can't even agree on it?”

With Pluto's ""demotion"" to dwarf planet status, it’s understandable that the IAU faced criticism from the public for redefining a ""planet"" in such a way that seemed almost tailored to exclude Pluto, along with bodies like Eris, Ceres and Pallas.

""I don't want to cast aspersions on the IAU,"" Schindler said, ""it may be a legitimate definition, but it's interesting to think about the fact we didn't have one beforehand. We don't really have a clear definition of what a planet is; I guess you can say we do now, but it still needs help.""

After all, what does it mean for a planet to ""clear its orbit of other debris,"" which is the single criterion that Pluto fails? Do Jupiter's Trojan asteroids qualify as cleared? Earth has plenty of asteroids and other debris in its orbital vicinity, as well. Why do Earth and Jupiter meet this criteria, but Pluto doesn't?

""At some point, the International Astronomical Union will probably revisit it,"" Schindler said, ""but I think in some ways, nobody wants to touch it because it's become sort of an embarrassment. In trying to get to an agreement, not only on what to call a planet but how to decide on what qualifies as a planet, well, the first step was kind of embarrassing. So nobody is in a hurry to revisit it right now.""

Seeing Pluto up close revived the debate

Before Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status, it was really nothing more than a tiny dot in telescopes; barely a few blurry pixels in an image, and that's if you were lucky. Even the Hubble Space Telescope, despite all its might, revealed little about the enigmatic object lurking beyond Neptune — but in 2015, NASA's New Horizons probe gave us our first detailed look at the distant world.

What most people were arguing about in 2006 through 2014 was mostly academic and sentimental. If you grew up learning that Pluto was a planet, chances are you were sticking to that, no matter what the IAU said.

After all, it's not like anyone had truly seen Pluto before New Horizons performed its 2015 fly-by. And sure enough, afterward, there was definitely a shift — in Pluto's favor. The images New Horizons sent back were breathtaking , revealing an active, complex planet with mountains, valleys and a now-iconic heart-shaped feature known as Tombaugh Regio.

""New Horizons essentially turned Pluto from a dot to a world where you can see mountains and craters and valleys, all this stuff up close,"" Schindler said. ""We never saw anything close to that on Pluto before.""

The mission confirmed that Pluto is far from a lifeless rock — it has a dynamic surface, an atmosphere, and potential geological activity, and this only reinforced opinions that Pluto was indeed a planet and had gotten a bad deal from the IAU.

""There's this perception that Pluto got dumped."" Kevin Schindler, Lowell Observatory’s Public Information Officer.

""In some ways, Pluto's more of a planet than some of the other established planets, like Mercury,"" Schindler said. ""Pluto has several moons orbiting around it and it has an atmosphere. Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere and it has no moons. Venus doesn't have a moon, either. Sometimes, if we think traditionally about what a planet is, people will say 'Well, it's round, maybe it has some moons, maybe it has an atmosphere.'

""Well, Pluto has them all.""

Celebrating the legacy of discovery

Despite its ""demotion,"" humanity's fascination with Pluto hasn't waned. Every year, the Lowell Observatory hosts the I Heart Pluto Festival to celebrate the discovery and significance of the King of the Kuiper Belt. This event brings together scientists, space enthusiasts and even members of Clyde Tombaugh's family to honor Pluto's place in history.

""We started this festival as a way to celebrate Pluto's discovery and the cultural connections it has,"" Schindler said. ""It's about Pluto, but it's also about the inspiration of space and science.""

This year's festival theme, ""Boldly Go Beyond New Horizons,"" brings together figures from science and pop culture, including astronomers, Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy's son Adam Nimoy, and others, emphasizing Pluto's role in both scientific discovery and human imagination.

"" I heart Pluto because of its connections,"" Schindler said. ""I've worked at Lowell for almost 30 years, and through that time, I've gotten to know so many scientists and others that have a connection to Pluto. I never met Clyde Tombaugh, but I know his children very well, and the scientists at Lowell's laboratories are good friends that I work with, like Jim Christie, who discovered [Pluto's moon] Charon in the 1970s.

""For me, it's definitely the community around Pluto. Yes, I work at the place where it was discovered, but every day I walk past the office where Tombaugh made his discovery, and go past the telescope dome where he huddled himself in the cold and winter to take these pictures. It's really easy to recreate that day of discovery, and kind of follow his footsteps a little bit, and feel what he was feeling.""

In the end, we all heart Pluto

Pluto's story is one of perseverance, curiosity and the evolving nature of scientific knowledge. From Percival Lowell's ambitious search to Clyde Tombaugh’s groundbreaking discovery to the stunning revelations of New Horizons, Pluto continues to captivate us, despite the semantics around its classification.

""I personally think Pluto is a planet and it has nothing to do with the fact that it was discovered where I work,"" Schindler said. ""Ultimately, Pluto is the prototype of a third zone of the solar system. You have the inner terrestrial planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, then you have the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. And then, you have this third zone of icy dwarf planets, icy small bodies in the Kuiper Belt — and Pluto's the big one, the king of those.

""In some ways, what we call it doesn't matter,"" Schindler said. ""By naming it a planet or not, it trains us to understand what it is and how it was formed, and that's the kind of classification that science tries to achieve by seeing similar patterns or differences in the universe.""

Wherever the debate about Pluto’s status goes, one thing is for certain: Pluto's place in history — and in our hearts — is undeniable. Certainly, the more we learn about it, the more this enigmatic body will inspire us to discover more about the outer frontiers of our stellar neighborhood.","At just 23 years old, Clyde Tombaugh sent a series of drawings of the night sky to his local observatory in Arizona. He was hoping to get some feedback on what he'd drawn. Instead, he found out he'd discovered a new planet."

More pocked with craters than any other object in our solar system, Jupiter's outermost and second-biggest Galilean moon, Callisto, appears geologically unremarkable. In the 1990s, however, NASA's Galileo spacecraft captured magnetic measurements near Callisto that suggested that its ice shell surface—much like that of Europa, another moon of Jupiter—may encase a salty, liquid water ocean.

But evidence for Callisto's subsurface ocean has remained inconclusive, as the moon has an intense ionosphere. Scientists thought this electrically conductive upper part of the moon's atmosphere might imitate the magnetic fingerprint of a salty, conductive ocean.

Now, researchers have revisited the Galileo data in more detail. Unlike in prior studies, this team incorporated all available magnetic measurements from Galileo's eight close flybys of Callisto. Their expanded analysis much more strongly suggests that Callisto hosts a subsurface ocean.

The paper is published in the journal AGU Advances.

In addition to reanalyzing the flyby data with advanced statistical techniques, the team used computational models of Callisto's ionosphere and geophysical properties to examine whether a subsurface ocean is compatible with all available information.

They found that Callisto's ionosphere alone cannot explain all existing observations, but that a subsurface ocean in combination with the ionosphere can. Further exploring which scenarios best fit the data, the researchers predicted that the ocean is likely at least tens of kilometers thick, as measured from the top of the liquid ocean to its seafloor, and encased beneath a solid ice shell that itself could range from tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. Beneath the probable ocean lies a rocky interior.

These findings set the stage for spacecraft measurements that will be captured in the near future and should confirm, once and for all, whether Callisto is an ocean world. Close-up measurements are scheduled for NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) missions, both already launched. China's planned Tianwen-4 mission may also observe Callisto.

Confirmation of Callisto's status as an ocean world would likely prompt further investigation into its potential to support life—just as the confirmation inspired research into Europa.

Video shows 30-million-year-old skull of apex predator that could solve extinction riddle - USA TODAY,"Scientists in Egypt discovered a not-before-known apex predator that lived 30 million years ago, potentially helping to solve an extinction mystery.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/18/bastetodon-syrtos-egypt-video/79067961007/,science,"In a rare find, a team of scientists in Egypt uncovered a nearly complete skull that offers insight into a not-before-discovered apex predator species that lived 30 million years ago.

Published on Monday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the results of the desert dig painted the picture of a fearsome, big-cat creature with a strong jaw and sharp teeth that occupied the spot at the top of the food chain during the Oligocene Epoch era. Discovered in Fayum, Egypt, the powerful predator would have lived in a then-tropical rainforest environment.

The newly-discovered species, named Bastetodon syrtos, is part of the Hyaenodonta family, an extinct species of carnivore that evolved long before modern cats, dogs and hyenas but resembled early versions of modern big cats. This lineage once ruled the food chain in the time after dinosaurs went extinct, preying on primates, early hippos, early elephants and hyraxes, but were later wiped out themselves.

In life, the Bastetodon was leopard-sized with a short, cat-like snout, hyena-like teeth and a dog-like body.

A 'dream' discovery

The discovery of the most complete skull ever found belonging to the hyaenodonta subfamily hyainailourinae almost didn't happen, according to paleontologist and lead author Shorouq Al-Ashqar from Mansoura University and the American University in Cairo.

""Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable —a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground,"" she said in a statement. ""His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist.”

The team, called Sallam Lab, made the find while digging in the Fayum Depression, a basin in the desert known as one of the most significant fossil deposits in Africa. They chose to name the newly-found species after the ancient Egyptian goddess Bastet, the cat-headed symbol of protection, pleasure and good health.

New skull may help solve extinction riddle

The discovery also prompted Sallam Lab scientists to re-visit the findings on a separate lion-sized Hyaenodont species discovered more than 120 years ago. The team constructed the genus of Sekhmetop, named after the lion-headed goddess of wrath and war Sekhmet, and found that it, like the Bastetodon, originated in Africa and not Europe as 1904 scientists originally thought.

This finding gives scientists some more insight into what exactly happened to the once-fierce king of the jungle and its kin.

Hyaenodonts lived in Asia, Europe, India and North America - the new study demonstrates that Bastetodon and Sekhmetop likely spread from Africa to these regions in waves. The team theorized that ""cataclysmic"" changes in global climate and tectonic shifts made way for the distant relatives of modern cats, dogs and hyenas to begin evolving. As the environment and therefore its prey changed, hyaendodonts diminished in diversity and eventually went extinct.

""The discovery of Bastetodon is a significant achievement in understanding the diversity and evolution of hyaenodonts and their global distribution,” Al-Ashqa's statement continued. “We are eager to continue our research to unravel the intricate relationships between these ancient predators and their environments over time and across continents.”","Bastetodon syrtos is part of the Hyaenodonta family, an extinct species of carnivore that evolved long before modern cats. The powerful predator would have lived in a then-tropical rainforest environment."

Researchers at HSE University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have identified 15 key motives that drive human behavior. By analyzing people's views, preferences, and actions through an evolutionary lens, they demonstrated how these motives intertwine to shape habits and interpersonal relationships. The findings have been published in Personality and Individual Differences.

The question of what motivates human behavior has long intrigued psychologists. Various approaches are used to assess these underlying motives. The most well-known theory is Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, introduced in the mid-20th century. However, most approaches emphasize the social aspects of motivation while overlooking its evolutionary underpinnings.

A group of researchers at HSE University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine proposed analyzing human motives from an evolutionary perspective. In the proposed framework, all motives are viewed as evolutionary adaptations that enhanced early humans' ability to survive in their environment and continue to influence behavior today. The scientists proceed from the premise that if certain evolutionary mechanisms once triggered specific behaviors, the underlying motives can be identified using standard psychometric techniques.

To accomplish this, the study authors conducted an online survey with over 500 participants who were asked to rate 150 statements concerning their everyday preferences, fears, desires, and social aspirations. The statements were based on previously identified motives from other studies reflecting physical, reproductive, or social needs, such as ""I enjoy going on roller coasters,"" ""Eating is less important to me than it seems to be for most people,"" and ""I spend a lot of time staying in touch with my friends,"" among others.

Using network analysis, the researchers identified stable clusters of motives. The study found that human behavior is driven by 15 key motives, which can be grouped into five broad categories: environmental (Hoard, Create), physiological (Fear, Disgust, Hunger, Comfort), reproductive (Lust, Attract, Love, Nurture), psychological (Curiosity, Play), and social (Affiliate, Status, Justice).

The researchers also identified functional relationships between motives, contributing to a deeper understanding of motivational structures. For example, Justice has strong ties to Nurture and Curiosity, suggesting that it is a function of both concern for the welfare of others and a need to keep abreast of where anti-social behaviors might be occurring.

Interestingly, the motives of Play and Status emerged as pivotal points of connectivity, interacting extensively with other nodes, suggesting they influence a broad range of related motives. Status appears to be important as it facilitates the attainment of other goals by providing access to resources that enhance the chances of success in life, including attracting a partner.

Maintaining status involves hoarding resources, fearing the loss of these resources, and effectively using them in various situations. The motive of play, in turn, helps develop the skills needed to maintain status and adapt to changing circumstances.

""Using network-based psychometric techniques, we were able to observe how motives interrelate. For instance, the motives of Love and Nurture are positioned close to each other in the network, which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, as caring for offspring enhances their chances of survival.

""Conversely, the motives of Fear and Curiosity often have opposing effects. Fear keeps us away from danger, but when excessive, it can suppress curiosity, which fosters knowledge and innovation,"" explains Albina Gallyamova, Junior Research Fellow at the HSE Centre for Sociocultural Research.

The study also revealed age- and gender-related variations in the significance of different motives. Women tend to show a greater interest in the motives of Nurture and Comfort, while men are more likely to focus on the motives of Status and Attraction. The researchers note that these differences are linked to the traditional roles men and women played in our evolutionary past.

Age also contributes to shaping our priorities. Younger individuals tend to be more focused on Status and Play, while as people age, Fear and concern for Comfort become more prominent. ""These changes reflect different life stages: initially, we strive to secure our place in society, and later, we focus on safety and survival,"" adds Gallyamova.

The study findings can be valuable in various fields, ranging from marketing to IT. For example, in advertising, understanding the motives of different social groups allows for more precise and effective communication. Youth focused on Status and Play are more likely to respond to incentives related to prestige and entertainment, while a more mature audience prioritizes safety, reliability, and comfort.

In the field of AI, understanding evolutionary motives enables a more human-centered approach, offering gamification and social interaction for younger users, while emphasizing convenience and simplicity for the older generation. In therapy, understanding the underlying motives can help provide a more accurate response to the client's needs. For example, addressing anxiety can take into account the evolutionary mechanism of avoiding danger and help strike a balance between safety and curiosity.

""Ultimately, understanding the evolutionary motives that drive our behavior enables us to create solutions that make people's lives more comfortable, safer, and more interesting,"" explains Gallyamova.

GEM-63XL motor test fired at Promontory as part of Vulcan Cert-2 investigation - NASASpaceflight.com,"After Vulcan’s otherwise successful second certification mission (Cert-2) on Oct. 4, 2024, was marred by…",https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/02/gem-63xl-test-fire/,science,"After Vulcan’s otherwise successful second certification mission (Cert-2) on Oct. 4, 2024, was marred by a nozzle separation on one of the rocket’s GEM-63XL solid rocket boosters, questions arose about how and whether this would impact Vulcan’s certification for national security missions. The third Vulcan flight was supposed to start the United Launch Alliance’s (ULA) launch schedule for 2025, but it has now been replaced by an Atlas V mission flying a Kuiper payload.

On Thursday, Feb. 13, as part of the investigation of the “observation” on Vulcan’s Cert-2 flight, Northrop Grumman (NGC) and ULA conducted a test firing of a GEM-63XL motor at NGC’s facility in Promontory, Utah. This firing, conducted during a winter storm that dropped inches of snow in the area, appears to have been successful, although the test results were still being analyzed.





Past test firings of the GEM-63XL lasted approximately 90 seconds and produced a thrust close to 450,000 lbs. This test would likely have had similar numbers. ULA CEO Tory Bruno posted about the firing on the social media app X while posing next to the fired booster.

Still steaming… Of the many static rocket motor firings I’ve done, this GEM63XL was the first in a blizzard! Thanks @northropgrumman for your hard work. And thank you General Garrant @USSF_SSC for your leadership and no kidding cold weather fortitude! pic.twitter.com/6br1yBAQqI — Tory Bruno (@torybruno) February 14, 2025

ULA spokesperson Julie Arnold stated to NSF “The investigation team is reviewing data from a static hot fire of a modified GEM 63XL [sic] booster in Utah on Feb.13 [sic]. This test was part of the process for understanding the root cause of the observation on a Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) during the Vulcan Cert-2 mission and we will provide additional details as we have them.”

After the Cert-2 mission lifted off Pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the ascent was nominal until 23 seconds after launch. At that point, a burn-through and plume discoloration appeared on the right SRB. At 37 seconds after liftoff the nozzle separated from the right SRB, and the Vulcan had to compensate for the resulting change in thrust.

The Vulcan’s BE-4 engines needed to swivel to adjust the flight path, and SRB separation occurred two minutes and nine seconds into flight instead of after the planned one minute and 48 seconds. All other events on the launch timeline occurred later than planned, and the second stage needed to compensate for the earlier SRB issue as well.

After the Cert-2 flight, Bruno stated that the failure originated in insulators bonded to the inside of the shell that later became the nozzle. He also stated that minor modifications were underway to correct the issue, and presumably, Thursday’s Promontory static firing would have tested these fixes. Up to 192 instrumentation channels would have been available to record the test motor’s performance.

Prior to Vulcan’s first launch in early 2024, two certification flights were planned before Vulcan could fly national security missions. The U.S. Space Force’s Assured Access to Space (USSF AATS) office was targeting the end of February for certification; the next scheduled Vulcan flight is the CRS SNC-1 mission no earlier than May 2025. However, further delays for SNC-1 are likely as the Dream Chaser Tenacity still needs additional work on its flight readiness.

National security missions like USSF-87, USSF-106, WGS-11+, and NROL-73 are waiting on Vulcan’s availability, with USSF-106 originally supposed to be Vulcan’s next flight after Cert-2. The Vulcan earmarked for that flight is now being destacked at the Government Vertical Integration Facility (VIF-G) on Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Instead, the next launch from this pad is now scheduled to be an Atlas V 551, carrying the Kuiper-1 broadband satellite constellation mission during the second quarter of this year.

The Kuiper missions are prepared at the Amazon Vertical Integration Facility and ULA hopes to launch a number of these flights in 2025. Originally, ULA had planned to launch up to 20 missions of all types this year. However, that target is now in question as the USSF AATS office decides when ULA will get the go-ahead to launch its scheduled Vulcan national security missions from Florida and California.

Both Vulcan flights to date have been with the VC2S version — Vulcan-Centaur with two solid rocket boosters and a standard fairing. However, the USSF-106 mission is to use the VC4S version with four SRBs to place a payload directly into geosynchronous orbit. The Vulcan can use zero, two, four, or six boosters, so the GEM-63XL is a very important piece of the rocket family’s capabilities.

Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers, and BYU shot 53% from the field in a wire-to-wire rout of the Jayhawks in a 91-57 win in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 17,978 fans at the Marriott Center.

Trevin Knell added 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists for the Cougars (18-7, 9-6 Big 12), and Mawot Mag scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting for a BYU squad that shot 55.9% from the perimeter.

Dallin Hall supplied 10 points and eight assists, and Keba Keita added 10 points, nine rebounds, two steals and two thunderous blocks that blew the roof off the gym. Was it the best game — or at least, most complete — of the season for BYU, which won its third straight and seventh in the last nine games?

""I think so,"" BYU coach Kevin Young said. ""And we picked a good night to do it.""

Boy, did they.

The win puts the Cougars alone in fifth place in the Big 12 Conference with five games remaining — and three of them on the road, including Saturday at No. 19 Arizona (8 p.m. MST, ESPN). There's also that tricky road spot March 4 at No. 8 Iowa State.

So Tuesday's win was significant for many reasons.

""I feel like this is just a continuation of the past couple of games,"" said Knell, who shot 4-of-7 from 3-point range — one of four players with multiple triples among BYU's 14 makes. ""This is just another team win that we're stacking; every day in practice, we're competing and it's showing out on the court.

""It's a great team win, and I feel like it was a statement.""

The Jayhawks return to Lawrence, Kansas, having not led for 40 consecutive minutes en route to losses in three of their last four games and four of their last six. It's the first time Kansas has lost by at least 30 points to an unranked opponent since the Associated Press first began ranking teams in 1938, according to the AP.

Hunter Dickinson had 12 points and 14 rebounds for Kansas (17-9, 8-7 Big 12), which lost back-to-back games for the first time all year.

""They whooped us today,"" Dickinson said. ""They beat us by 36; I don't think there's anything personal about that. That's just one team that came out to play, and one team didn't.""

BYU couldn't have started much better, with an 8-0 jump that included the 215th career 3-pointer and 1,000th point by Knell.

Mag had 7 points in the first seven minutes, capping a 14-2 run to put the Cougars up 22-7 and forced Kansas coach Bill Self to use his second timeout.

""I thought we were awful, and I thought they were great. I think BYU could've beaten anybody tonight,"" said Self, whose 34-point loss was one of the worst since he was named head coach in 2003 and the third-worst defeat in the program's storied history. ""They were great — and we didn't do anything to make them play less than great.

""Our offense stunk, but that wasn't it,"" he added. ""We couldn't stop them, or get any momentum to stop them.""

But it didn't get much better.

Saunders poured in 14 points on a perfect 5-for-5 shooting, including four 3-pointers, and Knell canned four triples for 13 points as the Cougars shot 46.9% from the field with 10 3-pointers en route to a 46-26 halftime advantage.

BYU led by as much as 38 points midway in the second half, and never took its foot off the gas. The Cougars out-rebounded the Jayhawks 43-33, scored 15 points off 15 turnovers and assisted on 24-of-34 made field goals including five assists from Egor Demin.

""I think we're just hitting our stride right now at the right time of the year, playing our best brand of basketball,"" Hall said. ""We're less concerned with the opponent in front of us, and more concerned with executing our side of things: the game plan on both sides. I thought we did a really good job of that. We're hitting our stride, and trying to put the country on notice.""",Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers.

Kansas lawmakers reverse veto of ban on transgender care for minors - The Washington Post,The decision by the GOP-controlled legislature follows similar moves by about two dozen other states. Kansas’s Democratic governor had vetoed the bill last year.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/18/kansas-transgender-care-veto-overturned/,general,"The Republican-controlled legislature in Kansas on Tuesday overrode the Democratic governor’s veto of a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for minors, joining about two dozen states in placing such restrictions. Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, last year vetoed a bill that would have banned hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgery for people younger than 18.

“Infringing on parental rights is not appropriate, nor is it a Kansas value,” Kelly wrote last week in defense of her decision. “It is not the job of politicians to stand between a parent and a child who needs medical care of any kind.”

The votes to overturn the veto were 31-9 in the Kansas Senate and 85-34 in the House. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month attempting to end federal support for gender transition care for people younger than 19 — the latest move in line with his campaign promises to scale back care and protections for transgender individuals.

Kansas had been one of the only states where Republicans control the legislature without a law on transgender care for youths. A record number of bills targeting transgender people have made their way through state legislatures in recent years.

“Today, a supermajority of the Kansas Senate declared that Kansas is no longer a sanctuary state,” Senate President Ty Masterson (R) said in a statement posted Tuesday on social media. The action is also consistent with Trump’s executive order, he added.

In a similar move last year in Ohio, lawmakers overrode Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a bill limiting gender-affirming health care for youths under 18. The law was later upheld in court. Before the ban, families of transgender minors who lived in states with bans had been traveling to Ohio for treatment.

Under the revived Senate Bill 63, Kansas health-care providers who break the law by providing surgery, hormones or puberty blockers to children who identify as a gender that is different from their assigned sex at birth will be stripped of their licenses. It also prohibits the use of state funds for psychological treatment for transgender children.

Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day to officially recognize only two sexes; to direct agencies to issue government documents showing people’s sex “at conception” — which experts have said is inaccurate; to stop using gender identity or pronouns transgender people use; and to maintain women-only spaces in prisons and shelters.

He has since directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon’s policy on transgender troops, which could lead to a ban on their performing military service. Seven transgender troops and one person hoping to enlist have sued the government over the legality of Trump’s order.

About half of U.S. states have enacted bans on gender transition care, such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers, for minors. Puberty blockers are temporary and reversible, and they are also used to treat non-transgender youths who are experiencing early-onset puberty. Hormones can give a person physical traits that might help alleviate their gender dysphoria.

Most transgender children do not take medication to assist with their transition. There is no national database tracking those numbers, but among the dataset released by hospitals, a majority of young patients did not take any medication.

Gender transition surgeries are generally not recommended before a child turns 18, and health-care providers typically focus on counseling and assistance on “social transition,” such as changing names and clothing.",The votes to overturn the veto were 31-9 in the Kansas Senate and 85-34 in the House. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month attempting to end federal support for gender transition care for people younger than 19.
"Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on autos, chips and pharmaceuticals - CNN",President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/economy/us-new-tariff-plans-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,general,"CNN —

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.

Trump recently enacted a 10% across-board-tariff on goods coming from China and 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.

For tariffs on semiconductor chips and drugs, he told reporters at his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida that he intended to eventually increase the rate even more.

“It’ll go substantially higher over a course of a year,” he said. But he added that he wanted to give time for potentially affected companies to bring their factories to America to avoid tariffs.

“We want to give them a little bit of a chance,” he said.

The revelation comes days after Trump ordered an investigation into other nations’ tax and tariff policies, paving the way for new reciprocal tariffs to take effect as soon as April 2, the day after the investigation is set to conclude, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary said last week.

Trump’s latest announcement underscores his push for a more “balanced” trade with foreign markets and to reshore strategic industries. He has long criticized what he deems as unfair foreign treatment of US exports.

The steep new tariffs could have far-reaching effects, extending beyond the specific industries where taxes are levied, and hurt consumers with higher prices and businesses with increased costs, economists and industry experts have warned.

Consumers are expected to feel most of the burn by the new import taxes on automobiles, as prices of cars could jump by thousands of dollars, experts have warned. Nearly half of vehicle sales in the US last year, including cars and light trucks, were imported from foreign countries.

The president did not offer further details on whether the 25% tariff would be applied across the board to all countries or whether cars manufactured in Mexico and Canada under a free trade agreement Trump signed during his first term would be spared.

While US companies, like AI chipmaker Nvidia, dominate the semiconductor industry, manufacturing of chips has long been outsourced to Asia due to cost and technical reasons over the past decades. Nvidia declined to comment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pioneered the model of contract chipmaking, manufacturing chips for others without bearing its name, and it has emerged as the world’s largest contract chip producer.

TSMC told CNN that its chipmaking plants in Arizona, which were announced in 2020 during Trump’s first term, are on track as planned but declined to comment further.

Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of stealing America’s chip industry, a claim that experts dispute.

Though details remain unclear, new semiconductor tariffs could hurt Asian chip giants the most, including the likes of TSMC, South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix, whose manufacturing plants remain largely in Asia. The threat of new import taxes could also hasten the steps taken by these companies to set up shop or expand in the US.

As for the pharmaceutical industry, the US purchased more than $176 billion of drugs and related goods in 2023, according to US trade data, making it the largest importer of pharmaceutical products that year.

European, Indian and Chinese firms could be the hardest hit. In 2023, Ireland accounted for 20.4% of pharmaceutical imports, followed by 10.8% from Germany, 8.6% from Switzerland, 6.2% from India and 3.4% from China.",President Donald Trump said he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports.

"Pope Francis, still hospitalized, has pneumonia in both lungs - The Washington Post",Vatican officials cleared his schedule through the weekend due a “complex” infection plaguing the 88-year-old pontiff.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/18/pope-francis-pneumonia-hospitalized/,general,"ROME — Pope Francis is suffering from pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican disclosed late Tuesday, as officials cleared his schedule through the weekend because of a “complex” infection plaguing the 88-year-old pontiff. Francis, who had part of one lung removed in his youth, was admitted to Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic hospital Friday after developing another in a series of battles with bronchitis. Preliminary tests indicated that Francis had a respiratory tract infection and was running a slight fever as he underwent treatment.

Late Tuesday, however, the Vatican said chest X-rays showed he had developed a polymicrobial infection that arose from asthmatic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, a condition in which the airways widen, leading to a buildup of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. He is undergoing a “complex” treatment using antibiotic cortisone therapy, the Vatican said.

The pneumonia was detected during a chest CAT scan Francis underwent Tuesday afternoon, which was prescribed by his Vatican health team and hospital doctors.

“Nevertheless,” the Vatican said, “Pope Francis is in good spirits.”

The Vatican added that the pope ate breakfast Tuesday morning and, during the day, alternated rest with prayer and reading. Francis also received Holy Communion. The pope offered thanks for those who “continue to pray for him.”

Daniel Culver, chairman of pulmonary medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said an 88-year-old with pneumonia requiring hospitalization, “that’s a serious event.” He added, though, that “the majority of patients would still be expected to recover.”

“It’s very difficult to tell how serious” the pope’s pneumonia is without knowing more, Culver said, such as whether or not Francis is in intensive care, or requiring additional oxygen.

Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center and former chief scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said “there’s no question that it’s serious to have pneumonia and more serious when it affects both lungs.”

Reports that the pope was eating breakfast and reading Tuesday morning “are good things,” he added.

Francis has suffered from declining health and mobility for years, and this hospitalization is his fourth since ascending to the papacy in 2013. In 2021, the pope spent 10 days at Gemelli Polyclinic after having 13 inches of his colon removed. In March 2023, he was hospitalized for three days and treated for acute bronchitis after feeling a sharp pain in his chest and having trouble breathing. Francis later said he had pneumonia. He also had abdominal surgery in June 2023 to remove scar tissue and repair a hernia.

He had appeared bloated and weak in the days before his latest admission, often struggling to speak and passing to others tasks that involved his reading aloud. Italian media has reported that doctors had encouraged Francis to go to the hospital for days before he did so Friday.

Francis has fallen and injured himself twice in recent months: first in December, when he appeared with a bruise on his chin at a ceremony to install 21 new cardinals, and again in January, when he injured his right arm.

The Vatican had said Monday that Francis was suffering from a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract” — indicating that the pope was fighting a multipronged infection that it said required “adequate hospitalization.”

His doctors, the Vatican said, have ordered “absolute rest.”

On Tuesday, the Vatican said Francis would skip a Saturday audience related to the church’s jubilee, which is bringing millions of Catholics to Rome this year. He was also scheduled to say a Sunday Mass but has delegated that duty to a senior Vatican official.","Pope Francis is suffering from pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican disclosed late Tuesday.

Dominican officials cram thousands of inmates facing no charges into overcrowded prisons - NPR,"Despite promises to improve the system, problems within prisons keep mounting. Critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for pretrial detentions in cases where no charges have been filed.",https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5301669/dominican-republic-prisons-overcrowding,general,"Dominican officials cram thousands of inmates facing no charges into overcrowded prisons

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — They're known as ""frog men,"" inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.

Thousands of them are crammed into the country's severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.

Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.

""Prisons have become no man's land,"" said Rodolfo Valentín Santos, director of the Dominican Republic's National Public Defense Office.

Over 60% of the country's roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.

But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valentín said.

He noted that the country's Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an ""exceptional"" measure. There are six other measures that don't involve prison time, including bail, but Valentín said they are rarely used.

'We have a situation'

On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzmán walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.

The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.

It is the country's oldest and most populated prison.

""You have to watch out for your life,"" said Lugo, who with Guzmán visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.

""There are a lot of them who are not doing well,"" Guzmán said of inmates there. ""There's extreme poverty.""

They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone's SIM card be recharged.

Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country's deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Higüey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.

After last year's fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country's more than 40 prisons.

""We must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country's prisons,"" Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.

Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country's western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.

""We don't take orders from politicians or anyone else,"" said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.

Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaquín Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.

Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria — he spent two years in solitary confinement there.

'On the brink of collapse'

In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country's other 19 prisons.

But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic's National Commission of Human Rights.

""The Dominican Republic's prison system is on the brink of collapse,"" the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.

In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valentín, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.

In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.

""The level of overcrowding…makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,"" the report read. ""In the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.""

Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valentín said.

A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hernández Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hernández has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.

Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germán Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germán said she is not granting media interviews.

Both Santana and Valentín said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.

Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.

Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.

While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.

The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge.", Dominican officials cram thousands of inmates facing no charges into overcrowded prisons. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime. Activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.

Most rumors have referred to the device as a new iPhone SE, since it will succeed the iPhone SE (3rd generation), but there is mounting evidence that the device will be named iPhone 16E instead of iPhone SE (4th generation).

As a refresher, the iPhone 16E name was first mentioned in December by Fixed Focus Digital, an account with more than two million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Later that month, a leaker known as Majin Bu on X also cited a source who claimed that the next iPhone SE will actually be named iPhone 16E.

In a follow-up post today, Majin Bu cited a source who has apparently seen an iPhone box with the name iPhone 16E on it. In addition, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes that Apple CEO Tim Cook's teaser post about a ""new member of the family"" being announced this Wednesday suggests that the device will indeed have a new name. And last, there are several Amazon listings for so-called iPhone 16E cases, although that could be guesswork.

Google app on iOS removing Gemini as it pushes users to full app - 9to5Google,The Google app for iOS is removing Gemini support as the company pushes iPhone users to the full Gemini app.,http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-app-removes-gemini/,general,"Google is informing iOS users that it will be removing Gemini support from the main Google app as it pushes users over to the full Gemini app.

One of the first ways to access Gemini on iOS was through the main Google app, which offered a switcher between Google Search and Gemini for several months. However, as Google has built out the Gemini experience, new features have been missing from the Google app – a key example being Gemini Live. That’s because Google has been focused on the full Gemini app for iOS, which launched in November.

Now, Google is letting iPhone and iPad users know that Gemini is “no longer available” in the Google app.

In an email sent to users, Google says that “Gemini is no longer available in the Google app,” emphasizing that “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini.” The email reads in part:

We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS. Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. With the Gemini app, you’ll have access to all of the same features and more.

Google removed the switcher interface earlier this month, as we previously reported, but the experience is currently still live in the app via the “More” tab with Google app v356.0 on iOS. However, we previously noticed that a pop-up that directs users to instead download the full Gemini app for iOS via the App Store.

Some users may no longer be able to use Gemini in the Google app for iOS

More than 150 whales stranded on remote Australian beach - BBC.com,"Though 90 of the 157 stranded whales survived, they could not be saved due to complex conditions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7e38py4geo,general,"Scores of whales to be euthanised after mass stranding in Australia

The false killer whales have beached in the north-west corner of Tasmania

Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.

They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.

A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.

Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.

False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.

Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.

Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.

""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.""

""It's just absolutely horrific.""

The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.

""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said.

""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.""

Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.

""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.

With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.

""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said.

That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.

Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"".

Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.

More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.

Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.

Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.

There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.

Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.","The whales are part of a pod of 157 that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest of the pod had died shortly after the stranding."

(AP) — An avalanche in Oregon’s Cascade Mountains has killed two backcountry skiers, authorities said Tuesday.

The Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that its search-and-rescue unit recovered two bodies west of Bend in Happy Valley, near Broken Top peak.

The couple had been skiing when an avalanche happened Monday at 6,700 feet (2,042 meters) on a south-facing slope, the Central Oregon Avalanche Center said in a social media post.

“We extend our deepest condolences to all who loved the couple who tragically lost their lives while doing what they loved,” the post said. “As longtime residents of Central Oregon, they have touched many lives, and their legacy will continue to live on in our community.”

Judge Chutkan rejects call from Democratic AGs for temporary restraining order blocking DOGE’s access to federal data - CNN,A federal judge declined on Tuesday to temporarily block Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency from accessing federal data systems at a slew of executive branch agencies.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/doge-temporary-restraining-order-chutkan/index.html,general,"CNN —

A federal judge declined on Tuesday to temporarily block Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency from accessing federal data systems at a slew of executive branch agencies.

The decision by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan is an early blow to efforts by a group of Democratic state attorneys general to hamstring Musk and DOGE as they undertake efforts to upend the federal workforce.

But the judge also indicated she was skeptical about the Trump administration’s statements about Musk and his powers in DOGE. Musk and DOGE’s access to closely guarded government data – including sensitive information it has collected about and from the American public – has become a battleground in the legal fight against the Trump administration’s efforts to reshape the federal bureaucracy.

The attorneys general sued Musk last week, arguing that his role in the government is a violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, which gives presidents the power to appoint officials who must then be confirmed by the Senate.

The states had asked Chutkan to temporarily prohibit Musk and DOGE from accessing government information systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Commerce.

They also wanted the judge to block Musk and DOGE from firing or placing on involuntary leave any employees at those agencies.

But Chutkan said that the states hadn’t shown “that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order.”

“The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,” she wrote in the 10-page ruling. “It remains ‘uncertain’ when and how the catalog of state programs that Plaintiffs identify will suffer.”

Chutkan went on to say that even though the states’ larger case against Musk is “strong,” their arguments at this stage in the litigation were not good enough to satisfy the standard that must be met to warrant emergency action by the court.

“Plaintiffs raise a colorable Appointments Clause claim with serious implications. Musk has not been nominated by the President nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise ‘significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,’” she wrote. “But even a strong merits argument cannot secure a temporary restraining order at this juncture.”

Chutkan, of the federal district court in Washington, DC, was appointed by President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the January 6, 2021, criminal case against President Donald Trump.

Warns DOJ to ‘make truthful representations’

A fiery footnote from Chutkan highlighted seeming contradictions between those assertions and Trump’s executive orders creating DOGE, which connected DOGE to agency personnel decisions.

“Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,” she wrote.

Other pending lawsuits accuse the administration of violating privacy law and other protections in allegedly allowing affiliates of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to take control of highly restricted government IT systems.

But the lawsuit from the attorneys general focuses on the constitutionality of Musk’s role in government. During the early stage of their case they sought to curtail his efforts to shrink federal agencies, which they said served critical functions for their residents.

The states told the judge that the temporary restraining order was needed to maintain the “status quo that existed prior to DOGE’s creation with Mr. Musk at the helm – a normally functioning federal government led by individual officers at their respective agencies.”

“Without a TRO, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm from the ongoing threats of disclosure of highly sensitive information and continued demolition of critical parts of federal agencies on which Plaintiffs depend,” the attorneys general wrote in court papers.

CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.

BYU hands No. 23 Kansas back-to-back losses with 3rd straight win - KSL.com,"Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers, and BYU shot 53% from the field in a wire-to-wire rout of the Jayhawks.",https://www.ksl.com/article/51256357/byu-hands-no-23-kansas-back-to-back-losses-with-3rd-straight-win,politics,"Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

PROVO — At the end of the night, the Kansas men's basketball team will return to Lawrence Regional Airport with as many minutes led in a basketball game in the Beehive State as when the Jayhawks started their two-game road trip.

Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers, and BYU shot 53% from the field in a wire-to-wire rout of the Jayhawks in a 91-57 win in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 17,978 fans at the Marriott Center.

Trevin Knell added 15 points, eight rebounds and four assists for the Cougars (18-7, 9-6 Big 12), and Mawot Mag scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting for a BYU squad that shot 55.9% from the perimeter.

Dallin Hall supplied 10 points and eight assists, and Keba Keita added 10 points, nine rebounds, two steals and two thunderous blocks that blew the roof off the gym. Was it the best game — or at least, most complete — of the season for BYU, which won its third straight and seventh in the last nine games?

""I think so,"" BYU coach Kevin Young said. ""And we picked a good night to do it.""

Boy, did they.

The win puts the Cougars alone in fifth place in the Big 12 Conference with five games remaining — and three of them on the road, including Saturday at No. 19 Arizona (8 p.m. MST, ESPN). There's also that tricky road spot March 4 at No. 8 Iowa State.

So Tuesday's win was significant for many reasons.

""I feel like this is just a continuation of the past couple of games,"" said Knell, who shot 4-of-7 from 3-point range — one of four players with multiple triples among BYU's 14 makes. ""This is just another team win that we're stacking; every day in practice, we're competing and it's showing out on the court.

""It's a great team win, and I feel like it was a statement.""

The Jayhawks return to Lawrence, Kansas, having not led for 40 consecutive minutes en route to losses in three of their last four games and four of their last six. It's the first time Kansas has lost by at least 30 points to an unranked opponent since the Associated Press first began ranking teams in 1938, according to the AP.

Hunter Dickinson had 12 points and 14 rebounds for Kansas (17-9, 8-7 Big 12), which lost back-to-back games for the first time all year.

""They whooped us today,"" Dickinson said. ""They beat us by 36; I don't think there's anything personal about that. That's just one team that came out to play, and one team didn't.""

BYU couldn't have started much better, with an 8-0 jump that included the 215th career 3-pointer and 1,000th point by Knell.

Mag had 7 points in the first seven minutes, capping a 14-2 run to put the Cougars up 22-7 and forced Kansas coach Bill Self to use his second timeout.

""I thought we were awful, and I thought they were great. I think BYU could've beaten anybody tonight,"" said Self, whose 34-point loss was one of the worst since he was named head coach in 2003 and the third-worst defeat in the program's storied history. ""They were great — and we didn't do anything to make them play less than great.

""Our offense stunk, but that wasn't it,"" he added. ""We couldn't stop them, or get any momentum to stop them.""

But it didn't get much better.

Saunders poured in 14 points on a perfect 5-for-5 shooting, including four 3-pointers, and Knell canned four triples for 13 points as the Cougars shot 46.9% from the field with 10 3-pointers en route to a 46-26 halftime advantage.

BYU led by as much as 38 points midway in the second half, and never took its foot off the gas. The Cougars out-rebounded the Jayhawks 43-33, scored 15 points off 15 turnovers and assisted on 24-of-34 made field goals including five assists from Egor Demin.

""I think we're just hitting our stride right now at the right time of the year, playing our best brand of basketball,"" Hall said. ""We're less concerned with the opponent in front of us, and more concerned with executing our side of things: the game plan on both sides. I thought we did a really good job of that. We're hitting our stride, and trying to put the country on notice.""",Richie Saunders erupted for 22 points with three assists and four 3-pointers.

Kansas lawmakers reverse veto of ban on transgender care for minors - The Washington Post,The decision by the GOP-controlled legislature follows similar moves by about two dozen other states. Kansas’s Democratic governor had vetoed the bill last year.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/18/kansas-transgender-care-veto-overturned/,politics,"The Republican-controlled legislature in Kansas on Tuesday overrode the Democratic governor’s veto of a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for minors, joining about two dozen states in placing such restrictions. Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, last year vetoed a bill that would have banned hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgery for people younger than 18.

“Infringing on parental rights is not appropriate, nor is it a Kansas value,” Kelly wrote last week in defense of her decision. “It is not the job of politicians to stand between a parent and a child who needs medical care of any kind.”

The votes to overturn the veto were 31-9 in the Kansas Senate and 85-34 in the House. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month attempting to end federal support for gender transition care for people younger than 19 — the latest move in line with his campaign promises to scale back care and protections for transgender individuals.

Kansas had been one of the only states where Republicans control the legislature without a law on transgender care for youths. A record number of bills targeting transgender people have made their way through state legislatures in recent years.

“Today, a supermajority of the Kansas Senate declared that Kansas is no longer a sanctuary state,” Senate President Ty Masterson (R) said in a statement posted Tuesday on social media. The action is also consistent with Trump’s executive order, he added.

In a similar move last year in Ohio, lawmakers overrode Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a bill limiting gender-affirming health care for youths under 18. The law was later upheld in court. Before the ban, families of transgender minors who lived in states with bans had been traveling to Ohio for treatment.

Under the revived Senate Bill 63, Kansas health-care providers who break the law by providing surgery, hormones or puberty blockers to children who identify as a gender that is different from their assigned sex at birth will be stripped of their licenses. It also prohibits the use of state funds for psychological treatment for transgender children.

Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day to officially recognize only two sexes; to direct agencies to issue government documents showing people’s sex “at conception” — which experts have said is inaccurate; to stop using gender identity or pronouns transgender people use; and to maintain women-only spaces in prisons and shelters.

He has since directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon’s policy on transgender troops, which could lead to a ban on their performing military service. Seven transgender troops and one person hoping to enlist have sued the government over the legality of Trump’s order.

About half of U.S. states have enacted bans on gender transition care, such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers, for minors. Puberty blockers are temporary and reversible, and they are also used to treat non-transgender youths who are experiencing early-onset puberty. Hormones can give a person physical traits that might help alleviate their gender dysphoria.

Most transgender children do not take medication to assist with their transition. There is no national database tracking those numbers, but among the dataset released by hospitals, a majority of young patients did not take any medication.

Gender transition surgeries are generally not recommended before a child turns 18, and health-care providers typically focus on counseling and assistance on “social transition,” such as changing names and clothing.",The votes to overturn the veto were 31-9 in the Kansas Senate and 85-34 in the House. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month attempting to end federal support for gender transition care for people younger than 19.
"Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on autos, chips and pharmaceuticals - CNN",President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/economy/us-new-tariff-plans-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,politics,"CNN —

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the United States as early as April 2.

Trump recently enacted a 10% across-board-tariff on goods coming from China and 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.

For tariffs on semiconductor chips and drugs, he told reporters at his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida that he intended to eventually increase the rate even more.

“It’ll go substantially higher over a course of a year,” he said. But he added that he wanted to give time for potentially affected companies to bring their factories to America to avoid tariffs.

“We want to give them a little bit of a chance,” he said.

The revelation comes days after Trump ordered an investigation into other nations’ tax and tariff policies, paving the way for new reciprocal tariffs to take effect as soon as April 2, the day after the investigation is set to conclude, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary said last week.

Trump’s latest announcement underscores his push for a more “balanced” trade with foreign markets and to reshore strategic industries. He has long criticized what he deems as unfair foreign treatment of US exports.

The steep new tariffs could have far-reaching effects, extending beyond the specific industries where taxes are levied, and hurt consumers with higher prices and businesses with increased costs, economists and industry experts have warned.

Consumers are expected to feel most of the burn by the new import taxes on automobiles, as prices of cars could jump by thousands of dollars, experts have warned. Nearly half of vehicle sales in the US last year, including cars and light trucks, were imported from foreign countries.

The president did not offer further details on whether the 25% tariff would be applied across the board to all countries or whether cars manufactured in Mexico and Canada under a free trade agreement Trump signed during his first term would be spared.

While US companies, like AI chipmaker Nvidia, dominate the semiconductor industry, manufacturing of chips has long been outsourced to Asia due to cost and technical reasons over the past decades. Nvidia declined to comment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pioneered the model of contract chipmaking, manufacturing chips for others without bearing its name, and it has emerged as the world’s largest contract chip producer.

TSMC told CNN that its chipmaking plants in Arizona, which were announced in 2020 during Trump’s first term, are on track as planned but declined to comment further.

Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of stealing America’s chip industry, a claim that experts dispute.

Though details remain unclear, new semiconductor tariffs could hurt Asian chip giants the most, including the likes of TSMC, South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix, whose manufacturing plants remain largely in Asia. The threat of new import taxes could also hasten the steps taken by these companies to set up shop or expand in the US.

As for the pharmaceutical industry, the US purchased more than $176 billion of drugs and related goods in 2023, according to US trade data, making it the largest importer of pharmaceutical products that year.

European, Indian and Chinese firms could be the hardest hit. In 2023, Ireland accounted for 20.4% of pharmaceutical imports, followed by 10.8% from Germany, 8.6% from Switzerland, 6.2% from India and 3.4% from China.",President Donald Trump said he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports.

"Pope Francis, still hospitalized, has pneumonia in both lungs - The Washington Post",Vatican officials cleared his schedule through the weekend due a “complex” infection plaguing the 88-year-old pontiff.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/18/pope-francis-pneumonia-hospitalized/,politics,"ROME — Pope Francis is suffering from pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican disclosed late Tuesday, as officials cleared his schedule through the weekend because of a “complex” infection plaguing the 88-year-old pontiff. Francis, who had part of one lung removed in his youth, was admitted to Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic hospital Friday after developing another in a series of battles with bronchitis. Preliminary tests indicated that Francis had a respiratory tract infection and was running a slight fever as he underwent treatment.

Late Tuesday, however, the Vatican said chest X-rays showed he had developed a polymicrobial infection that arose from asthmatic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, a condition in which the airways widen, leading to a buildup of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. He is undergoing a “complex” treatment using antibiotic cortisone therapy, the Vatican said.

The pneumonia was detected during a chest CAT scan Francis underwent Tuesday afternoon, which was prescribed by his Vatican health team and hospital doctors.

“Nevertheless,” the Vatican said, “Pope Francis is in good spirits.”

The Vatican added that the pope ate breakfast Tuesday morning and, during the day, alternated rest with prayer and reading. Francis also received Holy Communion. The pope offered thanks for those who “continue to pray for him.”

Daniel Culver, chairman of pulmonary medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said an 88-year-old with pneumonia requiring hospitalization, “that’s a serious event.” He added, though, that “the majority of patients would still be expected to recover.”

“It’s very difficult to tell how serious” the pope’s pneumonia is without knowing more, Culver said, such as whether or not Francis is in intensive care, or requiring additional oxygen.

Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center and former chief scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said “there’s no question that it’s serious to have pneumonia and more serious when it affects both lungs.”

Reports that the pope was eating breakfast and reading Tuesday morning “are good things,” he added.

Francis has suffered from declining health and mobility for years, and this hospitalization is his fourth since ascending to the papacy in 2013. In 2021, the pope spent 10 days at Gemelli Polyclinic after having 13 inches of his colon removed. In March 2023, he was hospitalized for three days and treated for acute bronchitis after feeling a sharp pain in his chest and having trouble breathing. Francis later said he had pneumonia. He also had abdominal surgery in June 2023 to remove scar tissue and repair a hernia.

He had appeared bloated and weak in the days before his latest admission, often struggling to speak and passing to others tasks that involved his reading aloud. Italian media has reported that doctors had encouraged Francis to go to the hospital for days before he did so Friday.

Francis has fallen and injured himself twice in recent months: first in December, when he appeared with a bruise on his chin at a ceremony to install 21 new cardinals, and again in January, when he injured his right arm.

The Vatican had said Monday that Francis was suffering from a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract” — indicating that the pope was fighting a multipronged infection that it said required “adequate hospitalization.”

His doctors, the Vatican said, have ordered “absolute rest.”

On Tuesday, the Vatican said Francis would skip a Saturday audience related to the church’s jubilee, which is bringing millions of Catholics to Rome this year. He was also scheduled to say a Sunday Mass but has delegated that duty to a senior Vatican official.","Pope Francis is suffering from pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican disclosed late Tuesday. Officials cleared his schedule through the weekend because of a “complex’ infection. Francis, who had part of one lung removed in his youth, was admitted to Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic hospital."

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — They're known as ""frog men,"" inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.

Thousands of them are crammed into the country's severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.

Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.

""Prisons have become no man's land,"" said Rodolfo Valentín Santos, director of the Dominican Republic's National Public Defense Office.

Over 60% of the country's roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.

But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valentín said.

He noted that the country's Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an ""exceptional"" measure. There are six other measures that don't involve prison time, including bail, but Valentín said they are rarely used.

'We have a situation'

On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzmán walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.

The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.

It is the country's oldest and most populated prison.

""You have to watch out for your life,"" said Lugo, who with Guzmán visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.

""There are a lot of them who are not doing well,"" Guzmán said of inmates there. ""There's extreme poverty.""

They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone's SIM card be recharged.

Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country's deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Higüey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.

After last year's fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country's more than 40 prisons.

""We must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country's prisons,"" Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.

Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country's western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.

""We don't take orders from politicians or anyone else,"" said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.

Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaquín Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.

Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria — he spent two years in solitary confinement there.

'On the brink of collapse'

In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country's other 19 prisons.

But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic's National Commission of Human Rights.

""The Dominican Republic's prison system is on the brink of collapse,"" the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.

In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valentín, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.

In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.

""The level of overcrowding…makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,"" the report read. ""In the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.""

Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valentín said.

A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hernández Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hernández has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.

Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germán Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germán said she is not granting media interviews.

Both Santana and Valentín said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.

Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.

Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.

While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.

The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge.", Dominican officials cram thousands of inmates facing no charges into overcrowded prisons.

Google app on iOS removing Gemini as it pushes users to full app - 9to5Google,The Google app for iOS is removing Gemini support as the company pushes iPhone users to the full Gemini app.,http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-app-removes-gemini/,politics,"Google is informing iOS users that it will be removing Gemini support from the main Google app as it pushes users over to the full Gemini app.

One of the first ways to access Gemini on iOS was through the main Google app, which offered a switcher between Google Search and Gemini for several months. However, as Google has built out the Gemini experience, new features have been missing from the Google app – a key example being Gemini Live. That’s because Google has been focused on the full Gemini app for iOS, which launched in November.

Now, Google is letting iPhone and iPad users know that Gemini is “no longer available” in the Google app.

In an email sent to users, Google says that “Gemini is no longer available in the Google app,” emphasizing that “Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini.” The email reads in part:

We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS. Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store. With the Gemini app, you’ll have access to all of the same features and more.

Google removed the switcher interface earlier this month, as we previously reported, but the experience is currently still live in the app via the “More” tab with Google app v356.0 on iOS. However, we previously noticed that a pop-up that directs users to instead download the full Gemini app for iOS via the App Store.

More than 150 whales stranded on remote Australian beach - BBC.com,"Though 90 of the 157 stranded whales survived, they could not be saved due to complex conditions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7e38py4geo,politics,"Scores of whales to be euthanised after mass stranding in Australia

The false killer whales have beached in the north-west corner of Tasmania

Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.

They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.

A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.

Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.

False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.

Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.

Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.

""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.""

""It's just absolutely horrific.""

The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.

""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said.

""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.""

Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.

""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.

With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.

""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said.

That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.

Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"".

Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.

More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.

Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.

Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.

There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.

Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.","The whales are part of a pod of 157 that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest of the pod had died shortly after the stranding."

Judge Chutkan rejects call from Democratic AGs for temporary restraining order blocking DOGE’s access to federal data - CNN,A federal judge declined on Tuesday to temporarily block Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency from accessing federal data systems at a slew of executive branch agencies.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/doge-temporary-restraining-order-chutkan/index.html,politics,"CNN —

A federal judge declined on Tuesday to temporarily block Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency from accessing federal data systems at a slew of executive branch agencies.

The decision by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan is an early blow to efforts by a group of Democratic state attorneys general to hamstring Musk and DOGE as they undertake efforts to upend the federal workforce.

But the judge also indicated she was skeptical about the Trump administration’s statements about Musk and his powers in DOGE. Musk and DOGE’s access to closely guarded government data – including sensitive information it has collected about and from the American public – has become a battleground in the legal fight against the Trump administration’s efforts to reshape the federal bureaucracy.

The attorneys general sued Musk last week, arguing that his role in the government is a violation of the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, which gives presidents the power to appoint officials who must then be confirmed by the Senate.

The states had asked Chutkan to temporarily prohibit Musk and DOGE from accessing government information systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Commerce.

They also wanted the judge to block Musk and DOGE from firing or placing on involuntary leave any employees at those agencies.

But Chutkan said that the states hadn’t shown “that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order.”

“The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,” she wrote in the 10-page ruling. “It remains ‘uncertain’ when and how the catalog of state programs that Plaintiffs identify will suffer.”

Chutkan went on to say that even though the states’ larger case against Musk is “strong,” their arguments at this stage in the litigation were not good enough to satisfy the standard that must be met to warrant emergency action by the court.

“Plaintiffs raise a colorable Appointments Clause claim with serious implications. Musk has not been nominated by the President nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise ‘significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,’” she wrote. “But even a strong merits argument cannot secure a temporary restraining order at this juncture.”

Chutkan, of the federal district court in Washington, DC, was appointed by President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the January 6, 2021, criminal case against President Donald Trump.

Warns DOJ to ‘make truthful representations’

A fiery footnote from Chutkan highlighted seeming contradictions between those assertions and Trump’s executive orders creating DOGE, which connected DOGE to agency personnel decisions.

“Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,” she wrote.

Other pending lawsuits accuse the administration of violating privacy law and other protections in allegedly allowing affiliates of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to take control of highly restricted government IT systems.

But the lawsuit from the attorneys general focuses on the constitutionality of Musk’s role in government. During the early stage of their case they sought to curtail his efforts to shrink federal agencies, which they said served critical functions for their residents.

The states told the judge that the temporary restraining order was needed to maintain the “status quo that existed prior to DOGE’s creation with Mr. Musk at the helm – a normally functioning federal government led by individual officers at their respective agencies.”

“Without a TRO, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm from the ongoing threats of disclosure of highly sensitive information and continued demolition of critical parts of federal agencies on which Plaintiffs depend,” the attorneys general wrote in court papers.

CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.

A$AP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, faced two felony counts of assault in connection with a 2021 shooting case. The BBC mentioned that a former friend, Terell Ephron, accused Mayers of firing shots at him over an argument. However, Mayers denied the allegations, claiming it was a prop gun and alleging that Ephron, who goes by A$AP Relli, had financial motives. The two had known each other since high school and the alleged incident occurred on November 6 not far from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Blake Lively Alleges Justin Baldoni Made Other Women “Uncomfortable” On ‘It Ends With Us’ & Says They Will Testify At Trial; Defamation Claim Added To Suit - Deadline,"In a 141-page amended complaint, Blake Lively says other women who were uncomfortable around Justin Baldoni will testify at trial, adds defamation claim",http://deadline.com/2025/02/blake-lively-latest-lawsuit-justin-baldoni-1236294318/,gaming,"With minutes to spare before a court-imposed deadline of midnight ET Tuesday, lawyers for Blake Lively have just filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star and director.

In a legal and cultural landscape where the blast radius from this battle was already pretty large, things just got a whole lot bigger, with more women cited in the amendment.

Also, with a settlement nowhere in sight, mediation rejected by all sides and contested telecom subpoenas, this saga of alleged misconduct, astroturfing and career crash-and-burning now finds Lively adding a defamation claim and civil conspiracy in her 141-page FAC (First Amended Complaint). There are also two new but not unexpected defendants in crisis PR firm Street Relations and its founder Jed Wallace.

Other Women

Perhaps more importantly, this time, in a complaint 48 pages longer than the New Year’s Eve complaint Lively first filed, there are at least two other women cited who allegedly suffered from the actions of Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Heath. The individuals’ names are left out of the document for now, but it notes that they intend to be witnesses in the trial starting next year in New York City federal court.

Watch on Deadline

Seeking to get Baldoni’s amended complaint dismissed, Lively’s amended complaint puts new emphasis on the harassment and the retaliation she detailed in previous filings. It states:

“The dangerous climate of threats, harassment, and intimidation fueled by the Defendants’ retaliation campaign has required Ms. Lively to alter her personal and professional life, and to take steps to protect innocent bystanders rather than exposing them to further harm. Thus, this Amended Complaint does not refer to certain witnesses by name, nor does it provide screen shots of their text messages. Importantly, however, these witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share the substance of their communications in this Amended Complaint as contained herein, and they will testify and produce responsive documents in the discovery process.”

Lively’s new filing claims Sony production executive Ange Giannetti was aware of the unease Lively and other women allegedly felt on IEWU. It goes on to say:

“More importantly, the Defendants’ false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth that Ms. Lively was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni and raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023, not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the Film in 2024. The experiences of Ms. Lively and others were documented at the time they occurred starting in May of 2023. Importantly, and contrary to the entire narrative Defendants have invented, Mr. Baldoni acknowledged the complaints in writing at the time. He knew that women other than Ms. Lively also were uncomfortable and had complained about his behavior.”

Also, with many meetings, instances and reproduced text messages repeated from Lively’s first court filing at the end of last year (such as the apparent derailment of “the long-planned launch of her haircare line, Blake Brown” because of the alleged online smear campaign), tonight’s amended complaint seeks to illustrate the stakes in some very real and potentially frightening ways:

“The Defendants’ actions have created such a toxic climate of online vitriol against Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, and various fact witnesses, that all of the above have received disturbing threats. One fact witness known to publicly support Ms. Lively recently received a written threat indicating that the witness’s family would be sexually assaulted and killed unless the witness agreed to ‘make a statement and give the truth’ This type of climate was the predictable, if not inevitable, result of the retaliatory campaign launched by the Baldoni-Wayfarer parties, both before and after the litigation began.”

Read Blake Lively’s 141-page amended complaint against Justin Baldoni and others here.

Like the January 31 FAC that Baldoni and crew filed against Lively and Ryan Reynolds for defamation and extortion, replacing their initial $400 million complaint of January 16, Tuesday’s paperwork from Lively supplants her NYE suit that followed the December 20 filing in California’s Civil Rights department.

In both FACs, new defendants were added. In Baldoni’s case, it was the New York Times after he sued them individually December 31 for $250 million. Tonight, Lively brought onboard Street Relations chief and alleged social media manipulator Wallace along with previous defendants Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, its CEO and its moneyman, plus publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel and Nathan’s The Agency Group.

The inclusion of Wallace and Street Relations was anticipated over the past few weeks.

However, with a desired protective order against lead Team Baldoni lawyer Bryan Freedman coming up short with Judge Lewis J. Liman in the case’s first hearing earlier this month, the defamation claim now takes on an even more pointed role — with the former Megyn Kelly lawyer named specifically. “The statements Wayfarer, Baldoni, and Heath, through their agents, including Bryan Freedman, published about Ms. Lively are reasonably understood to state and imply that Ms. Lively fabricated claims of harassment and filed false claims of harassment with the Civil Rights Department of the State of California and with this Court,” the section on the defamation claim says.

Lively’s Camp Issues Statement

After the FAC was put in the court docket just before Wednesday ET, Lively’s main attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb outlined for Deadline where things are and where they see this all going.

“Ms. Lively has filed an amended complaint today that provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims. That evidence includes previously undisclosed communications involving Ms. Lively, representatives of Sony and Wayfarer, and numerous other witnesses. The complaint includes significant contemporaneous evidence that Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited; as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants’ retaliatory campaign.

“The amended complaint has also added a new claim for defamation based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint, and adds Jed Wallace and his company as defendants.

Over the next several weeks, we will move to dismiss the utterly meritless lawsuits brought against Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds, and we will move full speed ahead with discovery that we expect will reveal shocking details about the depth to which the Defendants have sunk in their unending efforts to ‘bury,’ ‘ruin,’ and ‘destroy’ Ms. Lively and her family.”

Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively in ‘It Ends With Us’ Sony

Representatives for Baldoni and the other defendants, Freedman and Sony did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on Tuesday’s filing. If any of them do, this post will be updated.

More To Come

With more than a year to go before trial is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2026, it is likely (like, certain) that there will be more filings. Tonight’s filings don’t even include the other lawsuits orbiting what went on during production of IEWU and the retaliation Lively alleges she was subjected to online last summer by Baldoni’s publicists Nathan and Abel, along with self-described “hired gun” Wallace.

Lively’s team recently pulled a deposition demand in Texas against Wallace as a prelude to putting his name and his company in the new amended complaint. On February 5, after Wallace denied he had anything to do with a smear campaign (despite what seem like references to him by Baldoni flacks in text messages), the Texas-based entrepreneur sued Lively for $7 million. Wallace asserted that his name being in Lively’s CRD complaint and coming up several times in the matter since has caused him “millions of dollars in reputational harm with a projected loss to his company that exceeds another million.”

It should be noted that Nathan and Abel have also said they never actually activated attacks on Lively in the lead-up to the August 2024 release of Sony’s It Ends With Us, “because the internet was doing the work for us,” as Abel wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post just before Christmas.

Now, just days after Lively and Reynolds walked the red carpet at 30 Rock and participated in the SNL50: The Anniversary Special, the internet will get busy and Wallace has been hauled into the big show. A show that is sure to get a lot wilder before next year’s trial start date comes around.",Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star.

There are no restrictions to shopping or important decisions. The moon is in Scorpio.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

A positive day

This is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. For four months, issues related to home and family have been muddled, confused and delayed. Fortunately, in the next 10 days, you’ll see a light at the end of the tunnel — and it won’t be a train.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

An average day

Discussions with spouses, partners, friends and groups will be practical and sensible today. Possibly, someone older or more experienced will have advice for you. If so, listen. (This might be challenging to do because you feel rebellious and restless today.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

A positive day

This is a productive day for you! Furthermore, it’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do. Think about long-term goals. Someone more experienced than you might have advice. (It never hurts to listen, because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A positive day

Because you’re in a practical frame of mind, you can learn and study. You can also make advances in a serious writing project or a manuscript. Or you can deal with the myriad details involved in planning a vacation. However, parents should be vigilant about their kids to avoid accidents.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

An average day

Tread carefully when dealing with authority figures today because something unexpected might happen. They might refuse a request or make an unusual demand or do something that you least expect. Therefore, play your cards close to your chest. Be sensible about financial matters.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

An average day

Pay attention to everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for you. On the upside, you might have some brilliant, genius-like ideas. Meanwhile, discussions with partners and spouses will be practical and sensible. Good time to wrap things up.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

An average day

Keep an eye on your money and your possessions because this is an unpredictable day for your assets. You might find money; you might lose money. Be smart and protect what you own against loss, theft or damage. Meanwhile, this is a productive day at work. Expect results.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

A positive day

Results will come to you today through willing acceptance of duty and obligation to others, especially children or partners in creative ventures. Do what you can to keep things practical and orderly. (Expect a few surprises from someone close to you.)

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

An average day

Today you might be dealing with hidden, private issues. (Or perhaps, you yourself might want to be hidden from others?) Practical discussions about home and family issues will take place. Meanwhile, something related to your job, your pet or your health might surprise you.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

An average day

You might meet a character today or someone you know (perhaps a friend or a member of a group) will do something that surprises you. Or perhaps the mandate of a group has changed in a way that surprises you? Meanwhile, this is a good day to tidy up the details of your everyday world.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

An average day

Be respectful when dealing with parents, bosses, teachers and the police today because their response to you might catch you off guard. (Never underestimate the power of courtesy.) Meanwhile, serious discussions about your assets and earnings might take place. Do your homework.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

A positive day

Be mindful of everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for your sign. Meanwhile, this is an excellent day to study and learn new things because you have perseverance and focus. You won’t overlook details. Some will focus on travel.

If your birthday is today

Actress Millie Bobby Brown (2004) shares your birthday. You are an independent problem solver who is sensitive to the needs of others. You are also mystical and artistic. This year, it’s your turn to socialize and have fun! Let your guard down and loosen up a bit. Old friends may reappear to rekindle relationships.

","Aries (March 21-April 19) is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. It’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do."

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The Los Angeles home of actress Nicole Kidman and musician Keith Urban was burglarized on Valentine's Day, sources told ABC News.

Around 8 p.m. Friday, the Los Angeles Police Department received a report of a burglary and responded to the celebrity couple's home.

Police say an unknown number of suspects smashed a glass door, ransacked the home and then took off. It's not clear what, if anything, was taken.

Kidman and Urban were not home at the time, and sources say it's not believed they were targeted.

The case is the latest burglary case nationwide involving celebrity victims.

ESPN reports LAFC soccer player Olivier Giroud lost approximately $500,000 worth of jewelry when his L.A. home was burglarized earlier this month.

Giroud, France's all-time top goal scorer, had 10 luxury watches stolen from him, a source told ESPN. The striker and his family were not at the property at the time.

The incident was reported to police early this month.

B.J. Novak gives loving tribute to Office costar Mindy Kaling: 'We always knew you'd be famous' - Entertainment Weekly News,"Ryan and Kelly forever! B.J. Novak gives adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) for his 'The Office' costar Mindy Kaling's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony: 'We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the …",https://ew.com/bj-novak-loving-tribute-office-costar-mindy-kaling-11682104,gaming,"Heads up Office fans — Ryan and Kelly are together again, this time for a very special reason.

B.J. Novak was on hand Tuesday for Mindy Kaling's ceremony to receive her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and gave an adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) at the event in her honor. After first meeting on the beloved sitcom in 2004, the duo, much like their aforementioned characters, had an on-again, off-again relationship in the early aughts, but ultimately ended that in 2007, and have been close friends ever since.

So it only made sense that Novak, who is also godfather to Kaling's three children, would be there to say a few words in support of the star.

He began by touting her many accomplishments in Hollywood — The Office, The Mindy Project, her many books and executive producing credits, to name a few — before joking, “at this point after all these successes, you also just know her from being famous, and that’s the part I want to say a few words about.”



""Mindy respects and understands [fame] in a very intuitive way because in addition to being a brilliant and wildly successful showrunner, an incredible mother of three, a deep and caring daughter and friend and mentor to so many, Mindy is also in her spare time, I assure you, very superficial,"" he joked.



Novak continued, citing Kaling's love of red carpet drama, wanting to know ""what really happened on the junket,"" and genuine interest in ""who wore it better.""

""She understands what fame means to people because she’s a normal person and it means something to her,"" he added. ""She knows it can be fun and interesting. She knows it can be inspiring. She knows it can be false and unfair and misleading and she knows it’s human nature to be curious about all of it. And as a result, even though it’s a job you can never fully control, it’s a job she handles beautifully.""

Getting emotional, he looked at his friend and said, “Mindy, as I look around and see all these people from your life who have believed in you from the beginning, I’m just sorry that none of us doubted you, because I know how much more fun that would make this for you. But we couldn’t help it. We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the job.”

""You'd be on the walk of talent if they had one,"" he concluded. ""You'd be on the walk of friendship. You'd be on the walk of compassionate parenthood, but let's face it all of these would be terrible field trips, so here you are instead, very deservedly, a person who means so much to so many on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.""



The lovefest wasn't just one-sided, though. Kaling also gave a shoutout to her longtime pal, whom she thanked on stage, calling him ""such an important and integral part of my family, that sometimes I forget the reason that I know him is because we worked together professionally, and I'm just as starstruck by him now, at 29, than I was when I first met you, at 24. I love you.""

Top TNA Star Appears On WWE NXT - https://wrestletalk.com/,"A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight's WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.",https://wrestletalk.com/news/top-tna-star-appears-wwe-nxt-moose/,gaming,"tna

A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight’s WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.

Tonight’s WWE NXT show was the first show since this past weekend’s WWE Vengeance Day event, which saw Oba Femi retain his NXT Championship against both Grayson Waller and Austin Theory.

After the match, Femi was jumped by the mysterious new group that made their mark on the show, who left him laying with an attack after his defence.

To kick off tonight’s NXT show, Oba came to the ring, where he called out the four men that took him out, but it wasn’t them who answered his call.

Instead, out came former TNA World Champion and current TNA X-Division Champion Moose, making his first ever appearance on NXT television amid the ongoing partnership between the two companies.

Moose got into the ring, where he challenged Oba to a match, saying that Moose vs. Oba Femi ‘has’ to happen.

Oba seemingly accepted his challenge, saying it ‘will’ happen, though no official date was given.

Moose is a current member of the System in TNA alongside Brian Myers, Eddie Edwards, Alisha Edwards and JDC.

JDC made his return to NXT television last week, where he lost to Lexis King in a Heritage Cup match.

Jay-Z Claims Now Dismissed Rape Case Cost Him $20M In Lost Income; Was Timed To Embarrass Daughter Blue Ivy At ‘Mufasa’ Premiere - Deadline,Jay-Z claims now dismissed rape of a minor case cost him millions in biz opportunities & tried to shame him with Beyoncé & Blue Ivy.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/jay-z-extortion-case-latest-sean-diddy-combs-1236293993/,gaming,"The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Jay-Z and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on.

Filed four days before the Buzbee-represented Jane Doe “voluntarily dismissed with prejudice” her claims, Jay-Z (aka Shawn Carter) made a declaration in the docket of Los Angeles Superior Court ripping the Texas-based attorney. Rejecting Buzbee’s attempt to have the Roc Nation boss’ defamation and extortion suit essentially gutted, Jay-Z’s February 10 filing says the “career-ending” accusations of assaulting a 13-year-old girl unsurprisingly damaged his business and his family — the former to the tune of $20 million a year.

While not mentioning the NFL, with which Roc Nation has a recently renewed Super Bowl Halftime Show deal, Jay-Z’s declaration makes clear that even if the Roger Goodell-run league was standing by him, others were much less inclined to do so:

“Mr. Buzbee’s actions undermined my relationship, and my company Roc Nation’s relationship, with other businesses in the sports and entertainment space,” the filing states. “We have agreements to produce entertainment programs for certain sporting events. After Mr. Buzbee filed the lawsuit, the media reported that other businesses could end their deals with Roc Nation, and forced one to speak out and address whether these false allegations would end our business relationship.

“Immediately after Mr. Buzbee went public with his false accusations, my company Roc Nation also lost other contracts in the sports and entertainment space that would have generated revenues of approximately $20 million per year.”

The rape of the then-teen Jane Doe is alleged to have occurred on the night of September 7, 2000 during one of Diddy’s drug-fueled parties after that year’s MTV VMAs. A graphic October 20, 2024 lawsuit from Buzbee first only named Combs, but made distinct reference to accomplices cited as male “Celebrity A” and a female “Celebrity B.” Jay-Z was named as “Celebrity A” in a December 8 refiling by Buzbee, which followed separate November 18 suit from a Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan-represented anonymous “celebrity and public figure who resides in Los Angeles” (later revealed to be Jay-Z) that went after the Texas lawyer for extortion.

After a flurry of filings, including several unsuccessful attempts at dismissal, one problematic NBC News sit-down featuring the now middle-aged Jane Doe and other media duels, the whole matter was pulled on February 14 by the plaintiff with no explanation by Buzbee.

On the other hand, Jay-Z said in a statement posted that day on Roc Nation’s X feed: “I would not wish this experience on anyone. The trauma that my wife, my children, loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed.”

In fact, on February 10, the multi-Grammy winner also got specific about what he viewed as a hit on him timing-wise when he was publicly named December 8.

“I was harshly criticized by others for accompanying my daughter to the premiere of her movie a day after Mr. Buzbee filed the Jane Doe lawsuit against me,” Jay-Z said of the full-tilt December 9 Los Angeles premiere of the Barry Jenkins-directed Mufasa: The Lion King that he attended with daughter Blue Ivy and his wife Beyoncé. “Media outlets reported that Disney was hesitant over my attendance at the premiere because of the accusations. I feel that Mr. Buzbee purposely filed this lawsuit on the eve of my daughter’s premiere to put me in the position of having to choose between supporting my daughter or hiding to avoid the negative press coverage.

“Buzbee’s assertion that there is nothing ‘extreme and outrageous’ about his false public claims that Mr. Carter is a serial child rapist is erroneous and appalling,” states an accompanying 22-page opposition to defendant’s motion to strike.

Despite all the citations of threats, alleged multiple victims, strong-arming by Buzbee for “something of substance” from Jay-Z for his clients, and the hip-hop icon’s attendance at big NFL games and the Grammys in recent weeks, this could all be DOA now, though a February 25 hearing in downtown L.A. remains on the books.

Deadline reached out to lawyers for both Jay-Z and Jane Doe for comment and clarification on the state of affairs, but the filing of judicial notice Tuesday in LASC may provide a clue.

In that paperwork, Jay-Z lawyer Robert M. Schwartz did note the February 14 dismissal in NYC and stressed, “given that Mr. Buzbee filed the dismissal four days after Mr. Carter filed his opposition to the anti-SLAPP Motion (on February 10), Mr. Carter could not have made the dismissal a part of his opposition.” The attorney added: “The voluntary dismissal with prejudice is relevant to Mr. Carter’s opposition to Defendants’ pending Special Motion to Strike (‘anti-SLAPP Motion’), which attacks the legal and factual bases of Mr. Carter’s claims for extortion, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

“The gravamen of Mr. Carter’s claims is that Mr. Buzbee failed to properly investigate Jane Doe’s claims before Mr. Buzbee publicly accused Mr. Carter of rape and threatened to refer him to law enforcement authorities, and then demanded that Mr. Carter pay his client ‘something of substance’ to buy her silence and avoid a ‘public spectacle’ and litigation.”

Schwartz goes on to make another point in today’s filing: “The factfinder in this case can reasonably infer from the voluntary dismissal that Buzbee’s public statements that Mr. Carter had raped Jane Doe were false, making them defamatory.”

Perhaps this is about to become a West Coast war now.

As for Combs, who still faces dozens of assault and abuse civil suits from Buzbee-represented plaintiffs and others, he remains behind bars at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center where he has been since his September 16 arrest. Failing on multiple occasions to get released on $50 million bail and looking at life in prison if found guilty, the Bad Boy Records founder is set to go to trial on racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges starting May 5.

It’s unlikely that Jay-Z will be showing up at that event, though even without him it will certainly be a spectacle.","The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Roc Nation boss and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on. In a February 10 filing, Jay-z made a declaration ripping the Texas-based attorney."
Of Course Justin Baldoni’s Lawyer Saw Ryan Reynolds’s SNL Cameo - Vulture,What — did you think a singular sentence from Ryan Reynolds alluding to the Justin Baldoni–Blake Lively legal drama during ‘SNL50’ wouldn’t somehow become a thing?,http://www.vulture.com/article/justin-baldoni-ryan-reynolds-snl50.html,gaming,"Baldoni and Reynolds.

No cultural institution is safe from somehow being implicated in the Blake Lively x Justin Baldoni drama. This week, it’s Saturday Night Live. Next week, we presume, it will be the Metropolitan Opera. Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds, made an appearance on SNL50, which aired on February 16, during a sketch helmed by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in which they answered audience members’ questions. In the sketch, Fey asks Reynolds how it’s going. “Great,” Reynolds responds. “Why? What have you heard?” Fey replies, “Good stuff only,” as Reynolds launches into a question about the Coneheads. A source on Baldoni’s legal team told “Page Six,” in response to the sketch, “Justin is taking this lawsuit in all seriousness and isn’t making a public mockery out of it.”

On February 17, Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded. “I’m unaware of anybody, frankly, whose wife has been sexually harassed and has made jokes about that type of situation,” Freedman said on the podcast Hot Mics With Billy Bush. “I can’t think of anyone who’s done anything like that. It surprised me.”

The legal drama stems from Baldoni and Lively’s time filming It Ends With Us, which Baldoni directed and both starred in. Lively filed a lawsuit in December 2024 against Baldoni and his crisis-PR team, alleging that Baldoni “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed,” then hired a crisis-PR team to retaliate against her in the press. Baldoni then filed a separate lawsuit against the New York Times as well as Lively, Reynolds, and their PR team, alleging defamation and civil extortion. The updates on the drama have since been never-ending, and SNL now gets to be a footnote in yet another crucial moment of the past half-century. Congrats to Lorne!",Ryan Reynolds appeared on Saturday Night Live. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler asked audience members about the Coneheads. Baldoni's lawyer said he's not aware of anyone whose wife has been sexually harassed.

Now, the actress has a question for Hollywood: ""Where's my reboot?""

Heaton, star of the new film The Unbreakable Boy, discussed with Yahoo Entertainment about all the shows getting the reboot or revival treatment these days on television. ""Why didn't I ever get on a show that could be rebooted?"" she joked. ""Because it seems like everybody [else is].""

In all seriousness, Heaton agreed with her former co-star Ray Romano, who recently told Yahoo that Everybody Loves Raymond should be left alone.

""It was just sort of perfection — and you don't wanna mess with perfection. You know, we've lost so many cast members, you couldn't reboot it because it won't be the same show,"" said Heaton, who starred as Debra Barone opposite Romano on the CBS sitcom from 1996 to 2005. The 66-year-old actress went on to reveal she has ""the same"" feelings about The Middle. ""Perfection.""

""The way they wrapped it up, where we got to flash-forward in the lives of the Heck family and see where they all ended up, it was so beautiful, and I think people have such a good feeling about the show,"" she explained. Heaton played the matriarch, Frankie Heck, from 2009 to 2018.

""The Middle is having such a resurgence on TikTok, of all places, that kids are rediscovering or discovering it for the first time. ... It's a beautiful thing,"" she said. ""It's like a great work of art — you don't need to go in there and touch it up or change it or do anything to it. Just let it be what it is. And the wonderful thing about TV and about streaming [is] you'll be able to enjoy it as much as you want.""

It's based on the true story of how a couple (played by Levi and Fahy) navigate raising their son Austin, who is autistic and has brittle bone disease.

""I've been a big supporter of [the autism] community for my whole life,"" Heaton said, in explaining why she chose to make this movie.

And I thought to myself, 'What about these parents who have a myriad of these differences in their children, and where did they turn?'"" She shares four adult children with her actor husband, David Hunt.

""I always worry about my kids and how they're gonna be in the world without me, and my kids are fine. How about families that have these issues? That's why a movie like this was so important when it came along. I wanted to be a part of it, because it's a story of triumph, and people need to see that,"" she said.

Who needs words when you have a rock like that, anyway?

Kuzma popped the big question on February 13 right before they took off for Turks and Caicos in a private jet full of roses, chocolate, and balloons, according to their engagement announcement in Vogue. While the model and athlete have been dating since 2020, Kuzma told the outlet he’d been dreaming up the proposal since their first visit to the Caribbean island in 2022. Post-private-jet flight, Harlow was surprised by her friends, family, and a celebration dinner on the beach outside of their villa. Congratulations to them!

"Kevin Spacey Tells Guy Pearce to ‘Grow Up,’ Denies Claim He ‘Targeted’ Actor - Rolling Stone",Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to 'grow up' after the latter said his 'L.A. Confidential' co-star 'targeted' him while making the 1997 movie.,http://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kevin-spacey-dismisses-guy-pearce-claim-targeted-1235271640/,gaming,"Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to “grow up” after Pearce claimed his former co-star “targeted” him when they worked together on L.A. Confidential.

Pearce has not leveled any specific allegations against Spacey, though in a 2018 interview, he called the actor a “handsy guy.” More recently, on the Awards Chatter podcast, Pearce said, “Even though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators… I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.”

In a video posted on X Tuesday, Feb. 18, Spacey responded, saying, “We worked together a long time ago. If I did something then that upset you, you could’ve reached out to me, we could’ve had that conversation.”

Spacey — who’s faced numerous claims of sexual misconduct, all of which he’s either denied or been cleared of in court — chastised Pearce for speaking on his experience to the press. He then complained that the press was “now coming after me because they’d like to know what my response is.” Spacey said, “You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”

Spacey went on to claim that after shooting L.A. Confidential Pearce traveled to Savannah, Georgia while he was filming Midnight in the Valley of Evil “just to spend time with me.” He questioned why Pearce did not mention that, saying, “Or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?” Spacey later alleged, “Maybe there was another reason, I don’t know. But that doesn’t make any sense that you would’ve just been leading me on, right?”

(Pearce did say on Awards Chatter that he “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin post-that that got ugly,” though did not specify what happened, or when.)

Spacey ended by saying, “But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I’ve been through hell and back to do what? Just in time to stop the bad guy. Is that what’s going on here? What took you so long? Did your horse run out of gas? I mean, you want to have a conversation, I’m happy to do so anytime, any place. We can even do it here live on X if you’d like, I’ve got nothing to hide. But Guy, you need to grow up. You are not a victim.”

Pearce said it wasn’t until “things came to light in 2017” that he started to comprehend the way Spacey had treated him on L.A. Confidential. At the time, he said, he would “brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing,’” adding that he was “scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man.”

When the other allegations against Spacey first emerged, Pearce said he “broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop.” He continued, “I think it really sort of dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had sort of either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever. That was a really incredible wake up call, I suppose.”","Guy Pearce said Kevin Spacey ""targeted"" him on L.A. Confidential.

'Bad Flu' Kept Dana Carvey Away From SNL's 50th - LateNighter,"We're now learning why one of Sunday night's SNL anniversary special's more conspicuous no-shows wasn't there.

For as much chatter as Sunday night’s star-packed SNL50: The Anniversary Special has generated since its broadcast, a disproportionate amount seems to have circled around the the famous alums who were not in attendance at the show.

We’re now learning why one of the more conspicuous no-shows wasn’t there.

Mike Schneider at Variety reports that “a bad flu” prevented Dana Carvey from participating in the show. Carvey had been a frequent presence on the show this season, playing the show’s Joe Biden through the election, and making additional appearances as The Church Lady, Elon Musk, and Al Pacino.

Carvey is expected to address his absence tomorrow when he catches up with David Spade in a new episode of their Fly on the Wall Podcast. (Spade was at the special, appearing in the John Mulaney-fronted “New York Musical” sketch.)

As we’ve reported, Bill Hader and Dan Aykroyd were also no-shows at the event. Aykroyd said as early as last August that he’d prefer to watch the show from home, while reps for Hader have said that he had a longstanding scheduling conflict.

Though the three former cast members were clearly missed, there were hundreds of others in attendance—so many, in fact, that some were apparently seated in a different studio entirely. The overflow crowd of former cast members, writers and others associated with the show was seated in Studio 8G (home to Late Night with Seth Meyers), where sources tell us drinks were served as attendees watched the proceedings taking place in the studio next door on monitors.",Dana Carvey was not in attendance at SNL50: The Anniversary Special.

"MAGA Outrage Over Tom Hanks’ ‘SNL50’ Sketch Is Understandable, Says Joy Behar: They Made ‘Anyone Who Voted for Trump Look Like a Racist’ - AOL",,https://www.aol.com/maga-outrage-over-tom-hanks-203727408.html,gaming,"Tom Hanks’ surprise appearance at “SNL50” sparked Republican backlash on social media, but some outspoken Democrats such as “The View” co-host Joy Behar understand the outrage. Hanks popped up as Donald Trump supporter Doug during the anniversary show’s “Black Jeopardy” sketch, a character he first played on “SNL” eight years ago. Sporting a red MAGA hat, Doug freaks out when Kenan Thompson’s “Black Jeopardy” host goes to shake his hand.

“The fact remains that they’re making anyone who voted for Trump look like a racist, and that’s why they’re mad,” Behar said about the backlash. “I personally would never do that, because I don’t believe that any group is one thing.”

More from Variety

“A lot of these people [who voted for Trump], in my opinion, have been misled,” she continued. “They thought that grocery prices would come down. They’re up. They thought inflation was coming down. It’s up. They thought that Medicaid was safe. It’s not. They thought Social Security was safe. It’s not. So it’s not only racism that caused Trump to be in office. We have to remember that. So of course they’re going to be insulted.”

Behar’s “The View” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin previously worked in Trump’s White House and said she “personally thinks the outrage over it is a little overblown.”

“Saturday Night Live” alum Victoria Jackson told TMZ that she was upset by Hanks’ appearance, and she pointed to comments made by political commentator Link Lauren on X that called the sketch “disgusting.”

“Tom Hanks just came out on ‘SNL’ in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a Black man’s hand,” Lauren posted. “This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. ‘SNL’ is an unfunny show for snobbish liberal elites. The current Republican Party is a big tent coalition compromised (sic) of many former Democrats. Good riddance, ‘SNL!'”

The actor revealed an interview with GQ magazine that he’s turned down a few Marvel offers in the past because the pay just wasn’t sufficient enough.

“The reason I didn’t do them had nothing to do with any artistic considerations whatsoever,” Malkovich said. “I didn’t like the deals they made, at all. These films are quite grueling to make… If you’re going to hang from a crane in front of a green screen for six months, pay me. You don’t want to pay me, it’s cool, but then I don’t want to do it, because I’d rather be onstage, or be directing a play, or doing something else.”

What Malkovich was surprised to discover was that filming “The Fantastic Four” was “not that dissimilar to doing theater” because “you imagine a bunch of stuff that isn’t there and do your little play.” He told GQ that he took a role in the movie primarily because he wanted to work with director Matt Shakman again after 2014’s “Cut Bank.”

“I should have just taken the serum,” says Sam Wilson in Captain America: Brave New World. His refusal to turn himself into a super-soldier like his predecessor, Steve Rogers, is a point of pride; it’s also a liability in a world filled with what another character refers to as “enhanced individuals.” This version of Captain America can’t do much against an opponent amped up on Gamma radiation, and he knows it.

The idea of a superhero suffering from performance anxiety—if not impostor syndrome—is resonant right now, as cracks appear in Marvel’s gleaming foundations. The signature image of Avengers: Endgame, with rows and rows of good guys staring down faceless CGI hordes, was the perfect emblem for a front-running brand defined by synergy and abundance. (“You wanted more?” asks Benedict Wong’s Sorcerer Supreme not so rhetorically.) Yet, in some ways, Thanos had it right all along. Even in 2018, there were too many Avengers to keep track of. Somebody had to be expendable.

Marvel’s endgame has always been to delay the endgame as long as possible. Now, it seems to be in the process of self-checkmate. Last year, Louis D’Esposito, the copresident of Marvel Studios, was quoted in Empire admitting that it had been “a rough time” for the company: “Maybe when you do too much, you dilute yourself a little bit.” Such self-reflection is admirable, but the problems go beyond oversaturation: The weaknesses are in the movies themselves. Trying to remember a genuinely resonant image or line of dialogue in Shang-Chi, The Marvels, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania makes for an arduous stroll down memory lane; not even hiring Sam Raimi to play his greatest hits could make Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness feel less obligatory. What does it say that the most memorable Marvel properties of the past few years have been MCU-adjacent flops such as Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter, which have gone viral not in spite of their badness but as a direct result? It is no longer Morbin’ time. It may never be again.

The exception to this downward spiral was 2024’s Deadpool & Wolverine, a spectacularly obnoxious but conceptually shrewd movie that pandered to its edgelord demographic while deftly summarizing a mainstream vibe shift. Like Thanos, the film’s villains were efficiency experts with a mandate to downsize their own intellectual property. The difference was that, from his side of the fourth wall, our hero could sort of see where they were coming from. “You’re coming in at kind of a low point,” Deadpool cheerfully explains to his old pal Wolverine, who’s none too pleased to be resurrected after getting a humane send-off in Logan. Deadpool’s getting at something true about the cyclical nature of empires: They’re never really built to last, even when they’ve been reinforced with vibranium.

After being delayed for a year by extensive reshoots, Captain America: Brave New World—originally subtitled New World Order until that phrase proved a bit too sensitive—has come limping into view as the punch line to Deadpool’s joke. Not that anybody is laughing, exactly. Advance word was that Julius Onah’s film had suffered from a troubled production; a new behind-the-scenes report published in Vulture confirmed it, quoting an unnamed crew member as saying, “Everybody on the crew knew that [this] was not going to be a good film.” That’s blunt, but it’s also an understatement. If Brave New World isn’t the worst movie ever released under the Marvel banner, it might just be the dullest—a humorless, grayed-out vision of contractual obligation featuring actors who look like they’d rather be anywhere else. Say what you will about Madame Web, but there was something charming about its pulpy, unpretentious ineptitude. Between its omnipresent and hilarious ADR and Dakota Johnson’s inability to open a Pepsi can, Madame Web is an endearingly surreal viewing experience (one I have personally seen twice). Brave New World is for completists only. It isn’t camp. It isn’t kitsch. It isn’t even a noble failure that goes down swinging. It’s just feeble, a movie that forgot to take the serum.

Usually when a big-budget movie like this goes wrong, it’s the director who ends up getting thrown under the bus. That’s not fair to Onah, whose last movie, Luce, about a Black student who runs afoul of his school’s administration, was full of bristling and contradictory ideas. His recruitment here indicates that Brave New World was supposed to be one of Marvel’s “serious” movies, and the setup feints at political complexity. It begins at the presidential inauguration of the feared and respected U.S. military commander General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who was played in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk by the late William Hurt behind a righteous mustache; we learn that in order to level up to the Oval Office, Ross—now played by Harrison Ford—had to ditch the soup strainer or risk the ire of focus groups everywhere.

Ross’s platform is “togetherness.” Apparently, there are a lot of single-issue voters out there. His biggest administrative dilemma is what to do about Tiamut, the “celestial island” that surfaced in the Indian Ocean at the end of Eternals, which contains the sort of bountiful, valuable natural resources that could bring global allies to the brink of war. Hoping to shed his image as a warmonger—and, in doing so, to redeem himself in the eyes of the daughter he alienated several movies/decades ago—Ross plans to share Tiamut’s adamantium with the rest of the free world. His presentation to a group of world leaders plays, amusingly, like an infomercial, or maybe a Marvel Studios shareholders meeting.

These plans for unity are waylaid following an assassination attempt at the White House with Sam in the house. The shooter is Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), the towering Korean War veteran—and “forgotten Captain America” introduced in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. As a former military guinea pig who was held in prison for 30 years, Isaiah has every reason to want revenge, but his confusion after pulling the trigger hints that he may be a Manchurian candidate. Sam is determined to clear his mentor’s name, which means going off the grid with the help of the next would-be Falcon, Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), and figuring out where the administration has gotten compromised. Between skirmishes with a freelance hitman played by Giancarlo Esposito and visits to a top-secret military facility—plot points that could both come from a game of Marvel Mad Libs—Sam uncovers (wait for it) a larger conspiracy designed to destabilize the ruling geopolitical empire for good.

It took five screenwriters to produce the script for Brave New World, which is light on inventive twists or memorable dialogue. What it does have is a lot of exposition, which is parceled out mostly through impromptu briefings. That’s what storytelling has become in the MCU: an extended game of catch-up favoring viewers whose security clearance is a yearly subscription to a streaming service. For all the hand-wringing about international aggression and mutually assured destruction, what’s really at stake is not the price of adamantium or the threat of nuclear war but the maintenance of continuity. What does it say that the movie’s not-so-secret Big Bad is basically a statistician whose MO is calculating probabilities? We’re supposed to hate him for trying to weaponize percentages against the good guys, but he’s actually the perfect avatar for a studio whose brain trust has historically gotten rich by hedging its bets.

If there’s a sympathetic figure in this quagmire, it’s Anthony Mackie, a charismatic actor who’s been waiting a decade for his above-the-title moment. While promoting the movie in Rome, he raised eyebrows by telling an interviewer, “Captain America represents a lot of different things, and I don’t think the term, you know, ‘America’ should be one of those representations.” While Mackie ended up walking things back by saying he was a “proud American” and that he supported the troops, his observation connects to Brave New World’s seriously janky politics. One reason the first Captain America worked was because it successfully yoked its hero’s sense of moral clarity to a throwback World War II narrative; the ’70s-paranoid-thriller qualities of The Winter Soldier were overstated but relatively fresh the first time around. At this point, whatever mileage there was to get out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra has been exhausted, and Sam’s idealism makes him look less like a paragon than a sap.

It’s never clear why Sam remains faithful to a government that kept a Black war hero locked away for so long, or why he tries to see the best in Ross, who spent his career trying to keep the Avengers off the board. He’s told at one point that his optimism makes him an “inspiration,” which sounds nice, especially coming from Sebastian Stan in “just here for the day” mode. It’s hard to take, though, in a cynically packaged narrative that’s about little more than upholding the status quo. (The peripheral presence of Black Widow operative Ruth Bat-Seraph, played by Shira Haas—who’s never referred to by her comic book moniker of Sabra but is directly identified as Israeli—has also been a point of controversy, with protestors calling for a boycott at the film’s premiere.)

Vulture’s article refers to Harrison Ford being unhappy on set, which is hardly news, but his frustration bleeds into his performance as Ross. He hasn’t been given much to play. His entire role is waiting for the other shoe to drop, or rather to explode when a big red foot bursts through it. It’s not a spoiler alert to reveal that Ross contains multitudes—Brave New World’s entire ad campaign depended on the promise of a Red Hulk. The image of an elected official rampaging through Washington, destroying everything he touches while waiting for somebody to talk him down—or blow him up—has some symbolic currency at the moment. Accidental prescience isn’t the same thing as satire, though, and Brave New World doesn’t commit to the metaphor in any sustained way. A funnier movie would have featured Red Hulk signing executive orders.

Last weekend, a friend of mine in Toronto went viral when he wondered if film critics should even have to review Marvel releases anymore. It was a good question: Brave New World made nearly $90 million domestically on opening weekend, which is considerably less than its predecessors, but still enough to suggest a certain impenetrable layer of critic-proofing. Though, at this point, it’s less about criticism—or even consumer reporting—than keeping tabs on something immense as it wobbles around on rubber legs. The recurring image of Tiamut, massive and half-submerged as various factions try to strip-mine it, is poetic in a way that doesn’t totally feel intended. It’s like a Marvel movie taking place among its own ruins.

It’s a Marvel tradition that its movies all have (at least) two endings: a final sequence and a stinger that, in theory, justifies sitting through 10 minutes of end credits. Brave New World lowers the bar on both fronts in a way that somehow suggests both a guilty conscience and complete disdain. There’s a conversation between Sam and Joaquin about the pressures of being a hero and the need to rise to meet opportunities. It’s almost as if Marvel is promising to do better next time. The stinger, meanwhile, features a locked-down villain vowing to send for reinforcements. “There will be others,” says the bad guy ominously. He seems to be speaking on behalf of his parent company.

YouTuber Lee Jin Ho takes down all videos related to Kim Sae Ron after Kim Sae Ron's father stated the late actress was extremely stressed watching his videos - allkpop,All videos related to the late Kim&nbsp;Sae Ron have been made private on YouTube reporter&nbsp;Lee Jin Ho's&nbsp;channel.As of Februar…,https://www.allkpop.com/article/2025/02/youtuber-lee-jin-ho-takes-down-all-videos-related-to-the-late-kim-sae-ron-after-kim-sae-rons-father-stated-the-late-actress-was-extremely-stressed-watching-his-videos,gaming,"All videos related to the late Kim Sae Ron have been made private on YouTube reporter Lee Jin Ho's channel.

As of February 17, it has been confirmed that all videos about Kim Sae Ron uploaded to 'Behind Master Lee Jin Ho' have been taken down. This is believed to be in response to growing criticism that excessive speculative reports and YouTube content contributed to Kim Sae Ron’s suicide.

Previously, reporter-turned-YouTuber Lee Jin Ho had produced multiple gossip-driven videos about the late Kim Sae Ron. One of these was about marriage rumors that surfaced in January.

On January 7, Lee Jin Ho speculated that Kim Sae Ron was preparing for marriage based on a social media post in which she wrote ""Marry"" alongside a photo of her in affectionate poses with a man.

When Lee Jin Ho attempted to contact Kim Sae Ron for clarification, he found that her number was unavailable. He then criticized her harshly, saying, ""It seems she even deleted her number due to the controversy. She lacks sincerity in her self-reflection and has no sense of responsibility as a celebrity.""

Lee Jin Ho also previously criticized Kim Sae Ron for allegedly drinking while on a self-imposed hiatus after her DUI incident. He questioned whether she was genuinely remorseful, although drinking itself is not an issue, only drinking and driving is. However, he framed the situation as if simply consuming alcohol was inherently wrong.

On February 17, Kwon Young Chan, head of the Korea Celebrity Suicide Prevention Association, who had met with Kim Sae Ron's father, pointed out an ""unnamed YouTuber"" during an interview. Kwon Young Chan stated, ""Kim Sae Ron's father said that his daughter suffered severe emotional distress due to YouTuber A’s videos.""

While the YouTuber was not explicitly named, considering that Lee Jin Ho continuously made speculative criticism about Kim Sae Ron, including ones regarding her wedding-themed photoshoot, and subsequently deleted all related videos, many believe Kwon Young Chan was referring to him.

Lee Jin Ho's channel has been flooded with angry comments demanding an apology. Netizens have left messages such as, ""Are you happy now that Kim Sae Ron is gone?,"" ""Cyberwrecker,"" ""You drove her to death,"" ""Deleting the videos is infuriating,"" and ""Murderer.""

Kwon Young Chan has since stated that if Kim Sae Ron’s family decides to take legal action against YouTuber 'A' or seek mediation through the Press Arbitration Commission, he will offer various forms of free support.

Meanwhile, Kim Sae Ron was found deceased in her Seoul home on February 16 at 4:54 PM. A friend who had planned to meet her discovered her and reported it to the police. Although no suicide note was found, authorities stated during a press briefing on February 17 that they believe she took her own life.

Meghan Markle’s Jam Business Has a New Name - The Cut,Meghan Markle has revamped her lifestyle brand-slash-jam company with a name that is both easier to say and less likely to get her into a patent dispute.,http://www.thecut.com/article/meghan-markle-new-as-ever-lifestyle-brand.html,gaming,"Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage

Good-bye, American Riviera Orchard. We hardly knew ye. On Monday, Meghan Markle announced that the lifestyle brand she launched last year — which hasn’t done much except send jam to her friends — is getting a revamp. American Riviera Orchard is out, and As Ever is in. Is that a better name? It certainly sounds less like an actor’s diction exercise, so that’s a plus, and it’s far less likely to get her into a patent dispute.

“Last year, I had thought, ‘American Riviera, that sounds like such a great name.’ It’s my neighborhood; it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara, but it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area,” Markle said in an Instagram video, her new favorite way of communicating. The brand relaunch is being paired with the release of Markle’s Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, which comes out in March. Until then, you can bide your time by looking at Markle’s new website, which features nothing but a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, but is frankly much more inviting than the ARO one ever was.

“Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show, but as my partner in my business, which was huge,” Markle continued, “so I thought about it, and I’ve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022, and this is the moment, and it’s called As Ever.”

Markle promised that As Ever will feel familiar to anyone who kept up with her pre-Harry lifestyle blog, The Tig. “If you’ve followed me since 2014 with The Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening — this is what I do,” Markle explained, “I haven’t been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years, but now I can, so as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first.”

This is all very exciting, but one thing about Markle is that she cannot do anything without sending people into a tizzy. It turns out that there’s already a small New York–based clothing brand called As Ever. The brand’s founder, Mark Kolski, wrote on Instagram, “In the last 36 hours there has been an outpouring of support and concern regarding recent events around our namesake brand. We are aware. We are not affiliated.” Kolski’s As Ever has been around since 2015, and he wrote that it will continue on as ever.

Somehow, that wasn’t the only bit of controversy. The new name came with a new logo, which features a palm tree flanked by two hummingbirds. While tabloids speculate those are sweet symbolic nods to her relationship with Prince Harry, one Spanish official thinks Markle stole her town’s seal. “Page Six” reported that Xisca Mora, the mayor of a 5,000-person Mallorcan town called Porreres, is not so touched by Markle’s new logo. Despite the fact that there are some differences — the palm tree looks different, Porreres’s birds are swallows instead of hummingbirds — Mora is “studying the case with the legal services of the Consistory to see what course of action should be taken.” In layman’s terms, she’s deciding if she wants to sue. For once, I’d like to see something go off without a hitch for Markle.

On the positive side of things, Markle promised that her refreshed endeavor will still include fruit preserves. (“Jam is my jam.”) There will also be … other things? Markle remained vague about what the deal is going to be with As Ever but said, “There are so many more products that I just love, and now it’s time to share them with you.” What could that mean? We’ll find out when As Ever launches alongside Markle’s Netflix show in two weeks — but my guess is that it’s, like, scented candles.

The singer shared a note in her stories, saying that she is “thankful” after a jury found A$AP Rocky not guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm from a 2021 case. According to AP News, the rapper’s three-week-long trial ended after the jury deliberated for three hours before announcing the verdict. Hearing this, he dove into his longtime partner’s arms inside the courtroom.

After A$AP Rocky’s acquittal in the highly publicized trial, Rihanna shared a photo on her Instagram Stories, revealing that she was “humbled.” She wrote in the note that “the glory belongs to God and God alone” before announcing she is “thankful” for her partner’s not guilty verdict. The Fenty Beauty founder, who shares sons RZA and Riot Rose with A$AP Rocky, exhibited unwavering support by attending court proceedings.

A$AP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, faced two felony counts of assault in connection with a 2021 shooting case. The BBC mentioned that a former friend, Terell Ephron, accused Mayers of firing shots at him over an argument. However, Mayers denied the allegations, claiming it was a prop gun and alleging that Ephron, who goes by A$AP Relli, had financial motives. The two had known each other since high school and the alleged incident occurred on November 6 not far from the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In addition, he thanked the jury for “saving my life” following the not-guilty verdict and later addressed reporters outside the venue, describing the four-year-long ordeal as a “crazy” experience. As per AP News, he further claimed that he was “thankful” and felt “blessed to be here right now to be a free man talking to y’all.”

Days before, Rihanna shared a heartfelt Instagram post for A$AP Rocky on Valentine’s Day with a naughty and nice video. In the caption, she mentioned, “Get u a valentine that still writes love letters.”

Blake Lively Alleges Justin Baldoni Made Other Women “Uncomfortable” On ‘It Ends With Us’ & Says They Will Testify At Trial; Defamation Claim Added To Suit - Deadline,"In a 141-page amended complaint, Blake Lively says other women who were uncomfortable around Justin Baldoni will testify at trial, adds defamation claim",http://deadline.com/2025/02/blake-lively-latest-lawsuit-justin-baldoni-1236294318/,music,"With minutes to spare before a court-imposed deadline of midnight ET Tuesday, lawyers for Blake Lively have just filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star and director.

In a legal and cultural landscape where the blast radius from this battle was already pretty large, things just got a whole lot bigger, with more women cited in the amendment.

Also, with a settlement nowhere in sight, mediation rejected by all sides and contested telecom subpoenas, this saga of alleged misconduct, astroturfing and career crash-and-burning now finds Lively adding a defamation claim and civil conspiracy in her 141-page FAC (First Amended Complaint). There are also two new but not unexpected defendants in crisis PR firm Street Relations and its founder Jed Wallace.

Other Women

Perhaps more importantly, this time, in a complaint 48 pages longer than the New Year’s Eve complaint Lively first filed, there are at least two other women cited who allegedly suffered from the actions of Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Heath. The individuals’ names are left out of the document for now, but it notes that they intend to be witnesses in the trial starting next year in New York City federal court.

Watch on Deadline

Seeking to get Baldoni’s amended complaint dismissed, Lively’s amended complaint puts new emphasis on the harassment and the retaliation she detailed in previous filings. It states:

“The dangerous climate of threats, harassment, and intimidation fueled by the Defendants’ retaliation campaign has required Ms. Lively to alter her personal and professional life, and to take steps to protect innocent bystanders rather than exposing them to further harm. Thus, this Amended Complaint does not refer to certain witnesses by name, nor does it provide screen shots of their text messages. Importantly, however, these witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share the substance of their communications in this Amended Complaint as contained herein, and they will testify and produce responsive documents in the discovery process.”

Lively’s new filing claims Sony production executive Ange Giannetti was aware of the unease Lively and other women allegedly felt on IEWU. It goes on to say:

“More importantly, the Defendants’ false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth that Ms. Lively was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni and raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023, not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the Film in 2024. The experiences of Ms. Lively and others were documented at the time they occurred starting in May of 2023. Importantly, and contrary to the entire narrative Defendants have invented, Mr. Baldoni acknowledged the complaints in writing at the time. He knew that women other than Ms. Lively also were uncomfortable and had complained about his behavior.”

Also, with many meetings, instances and reproduced text messages repeated from Lively’s first court filing at the end of last year (such as the apparent derailment of “the long-planned launch of her haircare line, Blake Brown” because of the alleged online smear campaign), tonight’s amended complaint seeks to illustrate the stakes in some very real and potentially frightening ways:

“The Defendants’ actions have created such a toxic climate of online vitriol against Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, and various fact witnesses, that all of the above have received disturbing threats. One fact witness known to publicly support Ms. Lively recently received a written threat indicating that the witness’s family would be sexually assaulted and killed unless the witness agreed to ‘make a statement and give the truth’ This type of climate was the predictable, if not inevitable, result of the retaliatory campaign launched by the Baldoni-Wayfarer parties, both before and after the litigation began.”

Read Blake Lively’s 141-page amended complaint against Justin Baldoni and others here.

Like the January 31 FAC that Baldoni and crew filed against Lively and Ryan Reynolds for defamation and extortion, replacing their initial $400 million complaint of January 16, Tuesday’s paperwork from Lively supplants her NYE suit that followed the December 20 filing in California’s Civil Rights department.

In both FACs, new defendants were added. In Baldoni’s case, it was the New York Times after he sued them individually December 31 for $250 million. Tonight, Lively brought onboard Street Relations chief and alleged social media manipulator Wallace along with previous defendants Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, its CEO and its moneyman, plus publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel and Nathan’s The Agency Group.

The inclusion of Wallace and Street Relations was anticipated over the past few weeks.

However, with a desired protective order against lead Team Baldoni lawyer Bryan Freedman coming up short with Judge Lewis J. Liman in the case’s first hearing earlier this month, the defamation claim now takes on an even more pointed role — with the former Megyn Kelly lawyer named specifically. “The statements Wayfarer, Baldoni, and Heath, through their agents, including Bryan Freedman, published about Ms. Lively are reasonably understood to state and imply that Ms. Lively fabricated claims of harassment and filed false claims of harassment with the Civil Rights Department of the State of California and with this Court,” the section on the defamation claim says.

Lively’s Camp Issues Statement

After the FAC was put in the court docket just before Wednesday ET, Lively’s main attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb outlined for Deadline where things are and where they see this all going.

“Ms. Lively has filed an amended complaint today that provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims. That evidence includes previously undisclosed communications involving Ms. Lively, representatives of Sony and Wayfarer, and numerous other witnesses. The complaint includes significant contemporaneous evidence that Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited; as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants’ retaliatory campaign.

“The amended complaint has also added a new claim for defamation based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint, and adds Jed Wallace and his company as defendants.

Over the next several weeks, we will move to dismiss the utterly meritless lawsuits brought against Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds, and we will move full speed ahead with discovery that we expect will reveal shocking details about the depth to which the Defendants have sunk in their unending efforts to ‘bury,’ ‘ruin,’ and ‘destroy’ Ms. Lively and her family.”

Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively in ‘It Ends With Us’ Sony

Representatives for Baldoni and the other defendants, Freedman and Sony did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on Tuesday’s filing. If any of them do, this post will be updated.

More To Come

With more than a year to go before trial is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2026, it is likely (like, certain) that there will be more filings. Tonight’s filings don’t even include the other lawsuits orbiting what went on during production of IEWU and the retaliation Lively alleges she was subjected to online last summer by Baldoni’s publicists Nathan and Abel, along with self-described “hired gun” Wallace.

Lively’s team recently pulled a deposition demand in Texas against Wallace as a prelude to putting his name and his company in the new amended complaint. On February 5, after Wallace denied he had anything to do with a smear campaign (despite what seem like references to him by Baldoni flacks in text messages), the Texas-based entrepreneur sued Lively for $7 million. Wallace asserted that his name being in Lively’s CRD complaint and coming up several times in the matter since has caused him “millions of dollars in reputational harm with a projected loss to his company that exceeds another million.”

It should be noted that Nathan and Abel have also said they never actually activated attacks on Lively in the lead-up to the August 2024 release of Sony’s It Ends With Us, “because the internet was doing the work for us,” as Abel wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post just before Christmas.

Now, just days after Lively and Reynolds walked the red carpet at 30 Rock and participated in the SNL50: The Anniversary Special, the internet will get busy and Wallace has been hauled into the big show. A show that is sure to get a lot wilder before next year’s trial start date comes around.",Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni in her sexual harassment and smear campaign lawsuit against her It Ends With Us co-star.

There are no restrictions to shopping or important decisions. The moon is in Scorpio.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

A positive day

This is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. For four months, issues related to home and family have been muddled, confused and delayed. Fortunately, in the next 10 days, you’ll see a light at the end of the tunnel — and it won’t be a train.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

An average day

Discussions with spouses, partners, friends and groups will be practical and sensible today. Possibly, someone older or more experienced will have advice for you. If so, listen. (This might be challenging to do because you feel rebellious and restless today.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

A positive day

This is a productive day for you! Furthermore, it’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do. Think about long-term goals. Someone more experienced than you might have advice. (It never hurts to listen, because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A positive day

Because you’re in a practical frame of mind, you can learn and study. You can also make advances in a serious writing project or a manuscript. Or you can deal with the myriad details involved in planning a vacation. However, parents should be vigilant about their kids to avoid accidents.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

An average day

Tread carefully when dealing with authority figures today because something unexpected might happen. They might refuse a request or make an unusual demand or do something that you least expect. Therefore, play your cards close to your chest. Be sensible about financial matters.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

An average day

Pay attention to everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for you. On the upside, you might have some brilliant, genius-like ideas. Meanwhile, discussions with partners and spouses will be practical and sensible. Good time to wrap things up.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

An average day

Keep an eye on your money and your possessions because this is an unpredictable day for your assets. You might find money; you might lose money. Be smart and protect what you own against loss, theft or damage. Meanwhile, this is a productive day at work. Expect results.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

A positive day

Results will come to you today through willing acceptance of duty and obligation to others, especially children or partners in creative ventures. Do what you can to keep things practical and orderly. (Expect a few surprises from someone close to you.)

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

An average day

Today you might be dealing with hidden, private issues. (Or perhaps, you yourself might want to be hidden from others?) Practical discussions about home and family issues will take place. Meanwhile, something related to your job, your pet or your health might surprise you.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

An average day

You might meet a character today or someone you know (perhaps a friend or a member of a group) will do something that surprises you. Or perhaps the mandate of a group has changed in a way that surprises you? Meanwhile, this is a good day to tidy up the details of your everyday world.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

An average day

Be respectful when dealing with parents, bosses, teachers and the police today because their response to you might catch you off guard. (Never underestimate the power of courtesy.) Meanwhile, serious discussions about your assets and earnings might take place. Do your homework.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

A positive day

Be mindful of everything you say and do because this is an accident-prone day for your sign. Meanwhile, this is an excellent day to study and learn new things because you have perseverance and focus. You won’t overlook details. Some will focus on travel.

If your birthday is today

Actress Millie Bobby Brown (2004) shares your birthday. You are an independent problem solver who is sensitive to the needs of others. You are also mystical and artistic. This year, it’s your turn to socialize and have fun! Let your guard down and loosen up a bit. Old friends may reappear to rekindle relationships.

","Aries (March 21-April 19) is a good day to wrap up details related to mortgages, loans, shared property and inheritances. It’s an excellent day to clear away clutter and get a better idea of what it is that you need to do."

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The Los Angeles home of actress Nicole Kidman and musician Keith Urban was burglarized on Valentine's Day, sources told ABC News.

Around 8 p.m. Friday, the Los Angeles Police Department received a report of a burglary and responded to the celebrity couple's home.

Police say an unknown number of suspects smashed a glass door, ransacked the home and then took off. It's not clear what, if anything, was taken.

Kidman and Urban were not home at the time, and sources say it's not believed they were targeted.

The case is the latest burglary case nationwide involving celebrity victims.

ESPN reports LAFC soccer player Olivier Giroud lost approximately $500,000 worth of jewelry when his L.A. home was burglarized earlier this month.

Giroud, France's all-time top goal scorer, had 10 luxury watches stolen from him, a source told ESPN. The striker and his family were not at the property at the time.

The incident was reported to police early this month.

B.J. Novak gives loving tribute to Office costar Mindy Kaling: 'We always knew you'd be famous' - Entertainment Weekly News,"Ryan and Kelly forever! B.J. Novak gives adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) for his 'The Office' costar Mindy Kaling's Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony: 'We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the …",https://ew.com/bj-novak-loving-tribute-office-costar-mindy-kaling-11682104,music,"Heads up Office fans — Ryan and Kelly are together again, this time for a very special reason.

B.J. Novak was on hand Tuesday for Mindy Kaling's ceremony to receive her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and gave an adorably touching tribute (and at times, roast) at the event in her honor. After first meeting on the beloved sitcom in 2004, the duo, much like their aforementioned characters, had an on-again, off-again relationship in the early aughts, but ultimately ended that in 2007, and have been close friends ever since.

So it only made sense that Novak, who is also godfather to Kaling's three children, would be there to say a few words in support of the star.

He began by touting her many accomplishments in Hollywood — The Office, The Mindy Project, her many books and executive producing credits, to name a few — before joking, “at this point after all these successes, you also just know her from being famous, and that’s the part I want to say a few words about.”



""Mindy respects and understands [fame] in a very intuitive way because in addition to being a brilliant and wildly successful showrunner, an incredible mother of three, a deep and caring daughter and friend and mentor to so many, Mindy is also in her spare time, I assure you, very superficial,"" he joked.



Novak continued, citing Kaling's love of red carpet drama, wanting to know ""what really happened on the junket,"" and genuine interest in ""who wore it better.""

""She understands what fame means to people because she’s a normal person and it means something to her,"" he added. ""She knows it can be fun and interesting. She knows it can be inspiring. She knows it can be false and unfair and misleading and she knows it’s human nature to be curious about all of it. And as a result, even though it’s a job you can never fully control, it’s a job she handles beautifully.""

Getting emotional, he looked at his friend and said, “Mindy, as I look around and see all these people from your life who have believed in you from the beginning, I’m just sorry that none of us doubted you, because I know how much more fun that would make this for you. But we couldn’t help it. We always knew you would be famous, but we had no idea how beautifully you’d handle the job.”

""You'd be on the walk of talent if they had one,"" he concluded. ""You'd be on the walk of friendship. You'd be on the walk of compassionate parenthood, but let's face it all of these would be terrible field trips, so here you are instead, very deservedly, a person who means so much to so many on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.""



The lovefest wasn't just one-sided, though. Kaling also gave a shoutout to her longtime pal, whom she thanked on stage, calling him ""such an important and integral part of my family, that sometimes I forget the reason that I know him is because we worked together professionally, and I'm just as starstruck by him now, at 29, than I was when I first met you, at 24. I love you.""

Top TNA Star Appears On WWE NXT - https://wrestletalk.com/,"A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight's WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.",https://wrestletalk.com/news/top-tna-star-appears-wwe-nxt-moose/,music,"tna

A top TNA Wrestling star made a surprise appearance to kick off tonight’s WWE NXT, challenging NXT Champion Oba Femi.

Tonight’s WWE NXT show was the first show since this past weekend’s WWE Vengeance Day event, which saw Oba Femi retain his NXT Championship against both Grayson Waller and Austin Theory.

After the match, Femi was jumped by the mysterious new group that made their mark on the show, who left him laying with an attack after his defence.

To kick off tonight’s NXT show, Oba came to the ring, where he called out the four men that took him out, but it wasn’t them who answered his call.

Instead, out came former TNA World Champion and current TNA X-Division Champion Moose, making his first ever appearance on NXT television amid the ongoing partnership between the two companies.

Moose got into the ring, where he challenged Oba to a match, saying that Moose vs. Oba Femi ‘has’ to happen.

Oba seemingly accepted his challenge, saying it ‘will’ happen, though no official date was given.

Moose is a current member of the System in TNA alongside Brian Myers, Eddie Edwards, Alisha Edwards and JDC.

JDC made his return to NXT television last week, where he lost to Lexis King in a Heritage Cup match.

Jay-Z Claims Now Dismissed Rape Case Cost Him $20M In Lost Income; Was Timed To Embarrass Daughter Blue Ivy At ‘Mufasa’ Premiere - Deadline,Jay-Z claims now dismissed rape of a minor case cost him millions in biz opportunities & tried to shame him with Beyoncé & Blue Ivy.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/jay-z-extortion-case-latest-sean-diddy-combs-1236293993/,music,"The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Jay-Z and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on.

Filed four days before the Buzbee-represented Jane Doe “voluntarily dismissed with prejudice” her claims, Jay-Z (aka Shawn Carter) made a declaration in the docket of Los Angeles Superior Court ripping the Texas-based attorney. Rejecting Buzbee’s attempt to have the Roc Nation boss’ defamation and extortion suit essentially gutted, Jay-Z’s February 10 filing says the “career-ending” accusations of assaulting a 13-year-old girl unsurprisingly damaged his business and his family — the former to the tune of $20 million a year.

While not mentioning the NFL, with which Roc Nation has a recently renewed Super Bowl Halftime Show deal, Jay-Z’s declaration makes clear that even if the Roger Goodell-run league was standing by him, others were much less inclined to do so:

“Mr. Buzbee’s actions undermined my relationship, and my company Roc Nation’s relationship, with other businesses in the sports and entertainment space,” the filing states. “We have agreements to produce entertainment programs for certain sporting events. After Mr. Buzbee filed the lawsuit, the media reported that other businesses could end their deals with Roc Nation, and forced one to speak out and address whether these false allegations would end our business relationship.

“Immediately after Mr. Buzbee went public with his false accusations, my company Roc Nation also lost other contracts in the sports and entertainment space that would have generated revenues of approximately $20 million per year.”

The rape of the then-teen Jane Doe is alleged to have occurred on the night of September 7, 2000 during one of Diddy’s drug-fueled parties after that year’s MTV VMAs. A graphic October 20, 2024 lawsuit from Buzbee first only named Combs, but made distinct reference to accomplices cited as male “Celebrity A” and a female “Celebrity B.” Jay-Z was named as “Celebrity A” in a December 8 refiling by Buzbee, which followed separate November 18 suit from a Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan-represented anonymous “celebrity and public figure who resides in Los Angeles” (later revealed to be Jay-Z) that went after the Texas lawyer for extortion.

After a flurry of filings, including several unsuccessful attempts at dismissal, one problematic NBC News sit-down featuring the now middle-aged Jane Doe and other media duels, the whole matter was pulled on February 14 by the plaintiff with no explanation by Buzbee.

On the other hand, Jay-Z said in a statement posted that day on Roc Nation’s X feed: “I would not wish this experience on anyone. The trauma that my wife, my children, loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed.”

In fact, on February 10, the multi-Grammy winner also got specific about what he viewed as a hit on him timing-wise when he was publicly named December 8.

“I was harshly criticized by others for accompanying my daughter to the premiere of her movie a day after Mr. Buzbee filed the Jane Doe lawsuit against me,” Jay-Z said of the full-tilt December 9 Los Angeles premiere of the Barry Jenkins-directed Mufasa: The Lion King that he attended with daughter Blue Ivy and his wife Beyoncé. “Media outlets reported that Disney was hesitant over my attendance at the premiere because of the accusations. I feel that Mr. Buzbee purposely filed this lawsuit on the eve of my daughter’s premiere to put me in the position of having to choose between supporting my daughter or hiding to avoid the negative press coverage.

“Buzbee’s assertion that there is nothing ‘extreme and outrageous’ about his false public claims that Mr. Carter is a serial child rapist is erroneous and appalling,” states an accompanying 22-page opposition to defendant’s motion to strike.

Despite all the citations of threats, alleged multiple victims, strong-arming by Buzbee for “something of substance” from Jay-Z for his clients, and the hip-hop icon’s attendance at big NFL games and the Grammys in recent weeks, this could all be DOA now, though a February 25 hearing in downtown L.A. remains on the books.

Deadline reached out to lawyers for both Jay-Z and Jane Doe for comment and clarification on the state of affairs, but the filing of judicial notice Tuesday in LASC may provide a clue.

In that paperwork, Jay-Z lawyer Robert M. Schwartz did note the February 14 dismissal in NYC and stressed, “given that Mr. Buzbee filed the dismissal four days after Mr. Carter filed his opposition to the anti-SLAPP Motion (on February 10), Mr. Carter could not have made the dismissal a part of his opposition.” The attorney added: “The voluntary dismissal with prejudice is relevant to Mr. Carter’s opposition to Defendants’ pending Special Motion to Strike (‘anti-SLAPP Motion’), which attacks the legal and factual bases of Mr. Carter’s claims for extortion, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

“The gravamen of Mr. Carter’s claims is that Mr. Buzbee failed to properly investigate Jane Doe’s claims before Mr. Buzbee publicly accused Mr. Carter of rape and threatened to refer him to law enforcement authorities, and then demanded that Mr. Carter pay his client ‘something of substance’ to buy her silence and avoid a ‘public spectacle’ and litigation.”

Schwartz goes on to make another point in today’s filing: “The factfinder in this case can reasonably infer from the voluntary dismissal that Buzbee’s public statements that Mr. Carter had raped Jane Doe were false, making them defamatory.”

Perhaps this is about to become a West Coast war now.

As for Combs, who still faces dozens of assault and abuse civil suits from Buzbee-represented plaintiffs and others, he remains behind bars at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center where he has been since his September 16 arrest. Failing on multiple occasions to get released on $50 million bail and looking at life in prison if found guilty, the Bad Boy Records founder is set to go to trial on racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges starting May 5.

It’s unlikely that Jay-Z will be showing up at that event, though even without him it will certainly be a spectacle.","The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs of repeatedly raping a minor in 2000 after the MTV VMAs was dismissed on Valentine’s Day, but the bitter relationship between the Roc Nation boss and attorney Tony Buzbee rages on. In a February 10 filing, Jay-z made a declaration ripping the Texas-based attorney."
Of Course Justin Baldoni’s Lawyer Saw Ryan Reynolds’s SNL Cameo - Vulture,What — did you think a singular sentence from Ryan Reynolds alluding to the Justin Baldoni–Blake Lively legal drama during ‘SNL50’ wouldn’t somehow become a thing?,http://www.vulture.com/article/justin-baldoni-ryan-reynolds-snl50.html,music,"Baldoni and Reynolds.

No cultural institution is safe from somehow being implicated in the Blake Lively x Justin Baldoni drama. This week, it’s Saturday Night Live. Next week, we presume, it will be the Metropolitan Opera. Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds, made an appearance on SNL50, which aired on February 16, during a sketch helmed by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in which they answered audience members’ questions. In the sketch, Fey asks Reynolds how it’s going. “Great,” Reynolds responds. “Why? What have you heard?” Fey replies, “Good stuff only,” as Reynolds launches into a question about the Coneheads. A source on Baldoni’s legal team told “Page Six,” in response to the sketch, “Justin is taking this lawsuit in all seriousness and isn’t making a public mockery out of it.”

On February 17, Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded. “I’m unaware of anybody, frankly, whose wife has been sexually harassed and has made jokes about that type of situation,” Freedman said on the podcast Hot Mics With Billy Bush. “I can’t think of anyone who’s done anything like that. It surprised me.”

The legal drama stems from Baldoni and Lively’s time filming It Ends With Us, which Baldoni directed and both starred in. Lively filed a lawsuit in December 2024 against Baldoni and his crisis-PR team, alleging that Baldoni “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed,” then hired a crisis-PR team to retaliate against her in the press. Baldoni then filed a separate lawsuit against the New York Times as well as Lively, Reynolds, and their PR team, alleging defamation and civil extortion. The updates on the drama have since been never-ending, and SNL now gets to be a footnote in yet another crucial moment of the past half-century. Congrats to Lorne!",Ryan Reynolds appeared on Saturday Night Live. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler asked audience members about the Coneheads. Baldoni's lawyer said he's not aware of anyone whose wife has been sexually harassed.
"Patricia Heaton says 'The Middle,' 'Everybody Loves Raymond' were TV 'perfection' and don't need reboots - Yahoo Entertainment","Patricia Heaton, whose most recent movie is ""The Unbreakable Boy,"" calls it ""a beautiful thing"" that TikTok has brought new fans to the sitcom ""The Middle.""",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/patricia-heaton-says-the-middle-everybody-loves-raymond-were-tv-perfection-and-dont-need-reboots-224747298.html,music,"Patricia Heaton was a mainstay on television for two decades, thanks to the sitcoms Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle. Now, the actress has a question for Hollywood: ""Where's my reboot?""

Heaton, star of the new film The Unbreakable Boy, discussed with Yahoo Entertainment about all the shows getting the reboot or revival treatment these days on television. ""Why didn't I ever get on a show that could be rebooted?"" she joked. ""Because it seems like everybody [else is].""

In all seriousness, Heaton agreed with her former co-star Ray Romano, who recently told Yahoo that Everybody Loves Raymond should be left alone.

""It was just sort of perfection — and you don't wanna mess with perfection. You know, we've lost so many cast members, you couldn't reboot it because it won't be the same show,"" said Heaton, who starred as Debra Barone opposite Romano on the CBS sitcom from 1996 to 2005. The 66-year-old actress went on to reveal she has ""the same"" feelings about The Middle. ""Perfection.""

""The way they wrapped it up, where we got to flash-forward in the lives of the Heck family and see where they all ended up, it was so beautiful, and I think people have such a good feeling about the show,"" she explained. Heaton played the matriarch, Frankie Heck, from 2009 to 2018.

""The Middle is having such a resurgence on TikTok, of all places, that kids are rediscovering or discovering it for the first time. ... It's a beautiful thing,"" she said. ""It's like a great work of art — you don't need to go in there and touch it up or change it or do anything to it. Just let it be what it is. And the wonderful thing about TV and about streaming [is] you'll be able to enjoy it as much as you want.""

Heaton appears next in the inspirational film The Unbreakable Boy alongside Zachary Levi, Meghann Fahy and Jacob Laval. It's based on the true story of how a couple (played by Levi and Fahy) navigate raising their son Austin, who is autistic and has brittle bone disease. However, it's Austin's ""unbreakable"" spirit that ends up teaching his father how to live.

""I've been a big supporter of [the autism] community for my whole life,"" Heaton said, in explaining why she chose to make this movie. ""I have one son who had learning differences, and just that small thing can really just make you so worried. And I thought to myself, 'What about these parents who have a myriad of these differences in their children, and where did they turn?'"" She shares four adult children with her actor husband, David Hunt.

""I always worry about my kids and how they're gonna be in the world without me, and my kids are fine. How about families that have these issues? That's why a movie like this was so important when it came along. I wanted to be a part of it, because it's a story of triumph, and people need to see that,"" she said.

The Unbreakable Boy is in theaters on Feb. 21.",Patricia Heaton says Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle should be rebooted. The actress played Debra Barone on the CBS sitcom from 1996 to 2005. Heaton is star of the new film The Unbreakable Boy.

"Kevin Spacey Tells Guy Pearce to ‘Grow Up,’ Denies Claim He ‘Targeted’ Actor - Rolling Stone",Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to 'grow up' after the latter said his 'L.A. Confidential' co-star 'targeted' him while making the 1997 movie.,http://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kevin-spacey-dismisses-guy-pearce-claim-targeted-1235271640/,music,"Kevin Spacey told Guy Pearce to “grow up” after Pearce claimed his former co-star “targeted” him when they worked together on L.A. Confidential.

Pearce has not leveled any specific allegations against Spacey, though in a 2018 interview, he called the actor a “handsy guy.” More recently, on the Awards Chatter podcast, Pearce said, “Even though I probably was a victim to a degree, I was certainly not a victim by any means to the extent that other people have been to sexual predators… I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.”

In a video posted on X Tuesday, Feb. 18, Spacey responded, saying, “We worked together a long time ago. If I did something then that upset you, you could’ve reached out to me, we could’ve had that conversation.”

Spacey — who’s faced numerous claims of sexual misconduct, all of which he’s either denied or been cleared of in court — chastised Pearce for speaking on his experience to the press. He then complained that the press was “now coming after me because they’d like to know what my response is.” Spacey said, “You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.”

Spacey went on to claim that after shooting L.A. Confidential Pearce traveled to Savannah, Georgia while he was filming Midnight in the Valley of Evil “just to spend time with me.” He questioned why Pearce did not mention that, saying, “Or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?” Spacey later alleged, “Maybe there was another reason, I don’t know. But that doesn’t make any sense that you would’ve just been leading me on, right?”

(Pearce did say on Awards Chatter that he “had a couple of confrontations with Kevin post-that that got ugly,” though did not specify what happened, or when.)

Spacey ended by saying, “But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I’ve been through hell and back to do what? Just in time to stop the bad guy. Is that what’s going on here? What took you so long? Did your horse run out of gas? I mean, you want to have a conversation, I’m happy to do so anytime, any place. We can even do it here live on X if you’d like, I’ve got nothing to hide. But Guy, you need to grow up. You are not a victim.”

Pearce said it wasn’t until “things came to light in 2017” that he started to comprehend the way Spacey had treated him on L.A. Confidential. At the time, he said, he would “brush it off and go, ‘Ah, that’s nothing,’” adding that he was “scared of Kevin because he’s quite an aggressive man.”

When the other allegations against Spacey first emerged, Pearce said he “broke down and sobbed, and I couldn’t stop.” He continued, “I think it really sort of dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had sort of either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever. That was a really incredible wake up call, I suppose.”","Guy Pearce said Kevin Spacey ""targeted"" him on L.A. Confidential.

'Bad Flu' Kept Dana Carvey Away From SNL's 50th - LateNighter,"We're now learning why one of Sunday night's SNL anniversary special's more conspicuous no-shows wasn't there. Dana Carvey was reportedly sidelined by ""a bad flu.""",https://latenighter.com/news/a-bad-flu-kept-dana-carvey-away-from-snls-50th/,music,"Carvey at SNL in November 2024 (Photo: Will Heath/NBC

For as much chatter as Sunday night’s star-packed SNL50: The Anniversary Special has generated since its broadcast, a disproportionate amount seems to have circled around the the famous alums who were not in attendance at the show.

We’re now learning why one of the more conspicuous no-shows wasn’t there.

Mike Schneider at Variety reports that “a bad flu” prevented Dana Carvey from participating in the show. Carvey had been a frequent presence on the show this season, playing the show’s Joe Biden through the election, and making additional appearances as The Church Lady, Elon Musk, and Al Pacino.

Carvey is expected to address his absence tomorrow when he catches up with David Spade in a new episode of their Fly on the Wall Podcast. (Spade was at the special, appearing in the John Mulaney-fronted “New York Musical” sketch.)

As we’ve reported, Bill Hader and Dan Aykroyd were also no-shows at the event. Aykroyd said as early as last August that he’d prefer to watch the show from home, while reps for Hader have said that he had a longstanding scheduling conflict.

Though the three former cast members were clearly missed, there were hundreds of others in attendance—so many, in fact, that some were apparently seated in a different studio entirely. The overflow crowd of former cast members, writers and others associated with the show was seated in Studio 8G (home to Late Night with Seth Meyers), where sources tell us drinks were served as attendees watched the proceedings taking place in the studio next door on monitors.",Dana Carvey was not in attendance at SNL50: The Anniversary Special.

"MAGA Outrage Over Tom Hanks’ ‘SNL50’ Sketch Is Understandable, Says Joy Behar: They Made ‘Anyone Who Voted for Trump Look Like a Racist’ - AOL",,https://www.aol.com/maga-outrage-over-tom-hanks-203727408.html,music,"Tom Hanks’ surprise appearance at “SNL50” sparked Republican backlash on social media, but some outspoken Democrats such as “The View” co-host Joy Behar understand the outrage. Hanks popped up as Donald Trump supporter Doug during the anniversary show’s “Black Jeopardy” sketch, a character he first played on “SNL” eight years ago. Sporting a red MAGA hat, Doug freaks out when Kenan Thompson’s “Black Jeopardy” host goes to shake his hand.

“The fact remains that they’re making anyone who voted for Trump look like a racist, and that’s why they’re mad,” Behar said about the backlash. “I personally would never do that, because I don’t believe that any group is one thing.”

More from Variety

“A lot of these people [who voted for Trump], in my opinion, have been misled,” she continued. “They thought that grocery prices would come down. They’re up. They thought inflation was coming down. It’s up. They thought that Medicaid was safe. It’s not. They thought Social Security was safe. It’s not. So it’s not only racism that caused Trump to be in office. We have to remember that. So of course they’re going to be insulted.”

Behar’s “The View” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin previously worked in Trump’s White House and said she “personally thinks the outrage over it is a little overblown.”

“Saturday Night Live” alum Victoria Jackson told TMZ that she was upset by Hanks’ appearance, and she pointed to comments made by political commentator Link Lauren on X that called the sketch “disgusting.”

“Tom Hanks just came out on ‘SNL’ in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a Black man’s hand,” Lauren posted. “This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. ‘SNL’ is an unfunny show for snobbish liberal elites. The current Republican Party is a big tent coalition compromised (sic) of many former Democrats. Good riddance, ‘SNL!'”

“The reason I didn’t do them had nothing to do with any artistic considerations whatsoever,” Malkovich said. “I didn’t like the deals they made, at all. These films are quite grueling to make… If you’re going to hang from a crane in front of a green screen for six months, pay me. You don’t want to pay me, it’s cool, but then I don’t want to do it, because I’d rather be onstage, or be directing a play, or doing something else.”

What Malkovich was surprised to discover was that filming “The Fantastic Four” was “not that dissimilar to doing theater” because “you imagine a bunch of stuff that isn’t there and do your little play.” He told GQ that he took a role in the movie primarily because he wanted to work with director Matt Shakman again after 2014’s “Cut Bank.”

“I should have just taken the serum,” says Sam Wilson in Captain America: Brave New World. His refusal to turn himself into a super-soldier like his predecessor, Steve Rogers, is a point of pride; it’s also a liability in a world filled with what another character refers to as “enhanced individuals.” This version of Captain America can’t do much against an opponent amped up on Gamma radiation, and he knows it.

The idea of a superhero suffering from performance anxiety—if not impostor syndrome—is resonant right now, as cracks appear in Marvel’s gleaming foundations. The signature image of Avengers: Endgame, with rows and rows of good guys staring down faceless CGI hordes, was the perfect emblem for a front-running brand defined by synergy and abundance. (“You wanted more?” asks Benedict Wong’s Sorcerer Supreme not so rhetorically.) Yet, in some ways, Thanos had it right all along. Even in 2018, there were too many Avengers to keep track of. Somebody had to be expendable.

Marvel’s endgame has always been to delay the endgame as long as possible. Now, it seems to be in the process of self-checkmate. Last year, Louis D’Esposito, the copresident of Marvel Studios, was quoted in Empire admitting that it had been “a rough time” for the company: “Maybe when you do too much, you dilute yourself a little bit.” Such self-reflection is admirable, but the problems go beyond oversaturation: The weaknesses are in the movies themselves. Trying to remember a genuinely resonant image or line of dialogue in Shang-Chi, The Marvels, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania makes for an arduous stroll down memory lane; not even hiring Sam Raimi to play his greatest hits could make Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness feel less obligatory. What does it say that the most memorable Marvel properties of the past few years have been MCU-adjacent flops such as Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter, which have gone viral not in spite of their badness but as a direct result? It is no longer Morbin’ time. It may never be again.

The exception to this downward spiral was 2024’s Deadpool & Wolverine, a spectacularly obnoxious but conceptually shrewd movie that pandered to its edgelord demographic while deftly summarizing a mainstream vibe shift. Like Thanos, the film’s villains were efficiency experts with a mandate to downsize their own intellectual property. The difference was that, from his side of the fourth wall, our hero could sort of see where they were coming from. “You’re coming in at kind of a low point,” Deadpool cheerfully explains to his old pal Wolverine, who’s none too pleased to be resurrected after getting a humane send-off in Logan. Deadpool’s getting at something true about the cyclical nature of empires: They’re never really built to last, even when they’ve been reinforced with vibranium.

After being delayed for a year by extensive reshoots, Captain America: Brave New World—originally subtitled New World Order until that phrase proved a bit too sensitive—has come limping into view as the punch line to Deadpool’s joke. Not that anybody is laughing, exactly. Advance word was that Julius Onah’s film had suffered from a troubled production; a new behind-the-scenes report published in Vulture confirmed it, quoting an unnamed crew member as saying, “Everybody on the crew knew that [this] was not going to be a good film.” That’s blunt, but it’s also an understatement. If Brave New World isn’t the worst movie ever released under the Marvel banner, it might just be the dullest—a humorless, grayed-out vision of contractual obligation featuring actors who look like they’d rather be anywhere else. Say what you will about Madame Web, but there was something charming about its pulpy, unpretentious ineptitude. Between its omnipresent and hilarious ADR and Dakota Johnson’s inability to open a Pepsi can, Madame Web is an endearingly surreal viewing experience (one I have personally seen twice). Brave New World is for completists only. It isn’t camp. It isn’t kitsch. It isn’t even a noble failure that goes down swinging. It’s just feeble, a movie that forgot to take the serum.

Usually when a big-budget movie like this goes wrong, it’s the director who ends up getting thrown under the bus. That’s not fair to Onah, whose last movie, Luce, about a Black student who runs afoul of his school’s administration, was full of bristling and contradictory ideas. His recruitment here indicates that Brave New World was supposed to be one of Marvel’s “serious” movies, and the setup feints at political complexity. It begins at the presidential inauguration of the feared and respected U.S. military commander General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who was played in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk by the late William Hurt behind a righteous mustache; we learn that in order to level up to the Oval Office, Ross—now played by Harrison Ford—had to ditch the soup strainer or risk the ire of focus groups everywhere.

Ross’s platform is “togetherness.” Apparently, there are a lot of single-issue voters out there. His biggest administrative dilemma is what to do about Tiamut, the “celestial island” that surfaced in the Indian Ocean at the end of Eternals, which contains the sort of bountiful, valuable natural resources that could bring global allies to the brink of war. Hoping to shed his image as a warmonger—and, in doing so, to redeem himself in the eyes of the daughter he alienated several movies/decades ago—Ross plans to share Tiamut’s adamantium with the rest of the free world. His presentation to a group of world leaders plays, amusingly, like an infomercial, or maybe a Marvel Studios shareholders meeting.

These plans for unity are waylaid following an assassination attempt at the White House with Sam in the house. The shooter is Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), the towering Korean War veteran—and “forgotten Captain America” introduced in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. As a former military guinea pig who was held in prison for 30 years, Isaiah has every reason to want revenge, but his confusion after pulling the trigger hints that he may be a Manchurian candidate. Sam is determined to clear his mentor’s name, which means going off the grid with the help of the next would-be Falcon, Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), and figuring out where the administration has gotten compromised. Between skirmishes with a freelance hitman played by Giancarlo Esposito and visits to a top-secret military facility—plot points that could both come from a game of Marvel Mad Libs—Sam uncovers (wait for it) a larger conspiracy designed to destabilize the ruling geopolitical empire for good.

It took five screenwriters to produce the script for Brave New World, which is light on inventive twists or memorable dialogue. What it does have is a lot of exposition, which is parceled out mostly through impromptu briefings. That’s what storytelling has become in the MCU: an extended game of catch-up favoring viewers whose security clearance is a yearly subscription to a streaming service. For all the hand-wringing about international aggression and mutually assured destruction, what’s really at stake is not the price of adamantium or the threat of nuclear war but the maintenance of continuity. What does it say that the movie’s not-so-secret Big Bad is basically a statistician whose MO is calculating probabilities? We’re supposed to hate him for trying to weaponize percentages against the good guys, but he’s actually the perfect avatar for a studio whose brain trust has historically gotten rich by hedging its bets.

If there’s a sympathetic figure in this quagmire, it’s Anthony Mackie, a charismatic actor who’s been waiting a decade for his above-the-title moment. While promoting the movie in Rome, he raised eyebrows by telling an interviewer, “Captain America represents a lot of different things, and I don’t think the term, you know, ‘America’ should be one of those representations.” While Mackie ended up walking things back by saying he was a “proud American” and that he supported the troops, his observation connects to Brave New World’s seriously janky politics. One reason the first Captain America worked was because it successfully yoked its hero’s sense of moral clarity to a throwback World War II narrative; the ’70s-paranoid-thriller qualities of The Winter Soldier were overstated but relatively fresh the first time around. At this point, whatever mileage there was to get out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra has been exhausted, and Sam’s idealism makes him look less like a paragon than a sap.

It’s never clear why Sam remains faithful to a government that kept a Black war hero locked away for so long, or why he tries to see the best in Ross, who spent his career trying to keep the Avengers off the board. He’s told at one point that his optimism makes him an “inspiration,” which sounds nice, especially coming from Sebastian Stan in “just here for the day” mode. It’s hard to take, though, in a cynically packaged narrative that’s about little more than upholding the status quo. (The peripheral presence of Black Widow operative Ruth Bat-Seraph, played by Shira Haas—who’s never referred to by her comic book moniker of Sabra but is directly identified as Israeli—has also been a point of controversy, with protestors calling for a boycott at the film’s premiere.)

Vulture’s article refers to Harrison Ford being unhappy on set, which is hardly news, but his frustration bleeds into his performance as Ross. He hasn’t been given much to play. His entire role is waiting for the other shoe to drop, or rather to explode when a big red foot bursts through it. It’s not a spoiler alert to reveal that Ross contains multitudes—Brave New World’s entire ad campaign depended on the promise of a Red Hulk. The image of an elected official rampaging through Washington, destroying everything he touches while waiting for somebody to talk him down—or blow him up—has some symbolic currency at the moment. Accidental prescience isn’t the same thing as satire, though, and Brave New World doesn’t commit to the metaphor in any sustained way. A funnier movie would have featured Red Hulk signing executive orders.

Last weekend, a friend of mine in Toronto went viral when he wondered if film critics should even have to review Marvel releases anymore. It was a good question: Brave New World made nearly $90 million domestically on opening weekend, which is considerably less than its predecessors, but still enough to suggest a certain impenetrable layer of critic-proofing. Though, at this point, it’s less about criticism—or even consumer reporting—than keeping tabs on something immense as it wobbles around on rubber legs. The recurring image of Tiamut, massive and half-submerged as various factions try to strip-mine it, is poetic in a way that doesn’t totally feel intended. It’s like a Marvel movie taking place among its own ruins.

It’s a Marvel tradition that its movies all have (at least) two endings: a final sequence and a stinger that, in theory, justifies sitting through 10 minutes of end credits. Brave New World lowers the bar on both fronts in a way that somehow suggests both a guilty conscience and complete disdain. There’s a conversation between Sam and Joaquin about the pressures of being a hero and the need to rise to meet opportunities. It’s almost as if Marvel is promising to do better next time. The stinger, meanwhile, features a locked-down villain vowing to send for reinforcements. “There will be others,” says the bad guy ominously. He seems to be speaking on behalf of his parent company. The existential threat—to the world and the audience—is already here.","'Captain America: Brave New World' was meant to put the MCU back on track. Now the Red Hulk has come and gone, and things somehow feel even more dire."
YouTuber Lee Jin Ho takes down all videos related to Kim Sae Ron after Kim Sae Ron's father stated the late actress was extremely stressed watching his videos - allkpop,All videos related to the late Kim&nbsp;Sae Ron have been made private on YouTube reporter&nbsp;Lee Jin Ho's&nbsp;channel.As of Februar…,https://www.allkpop.com/article/2025/02/youtuber-lee-jin-ho-takes-down-all-videos-related-to-the-late-kim-sae-ron-after-kim-sae-rons-father-stated-the-late-actress-was-extremely-stressed-watching-his-videos,music,"All videos related to the late Kim Sae Ron have been made private on YouTube reporter Lee Jin Ho's channel.

As of February 17, it has been confirmed that all videos about Kim Sae Ron uploaded to 'Behind Master Lee Jin Ho' have been taken down. This is believed to be in response to growing criticism that excessive speculative reports and YouTube content contributed to Kim Sae Ron’s suicide.

Previously, reporter-turned-YouTuber Lee Jin Ho had produced multiple gossip-driven videos about the late Kim Sae Ron. One of these was about marriage rumors that surfaced in January.

On January 7, Lee Jin Ho speculated that Kim Sae Ron was preparing for marriage based on a social media post in which she wrote ""Marry"" alongside a photo of her in affectionate poses with a man.

When Lee Jin Ho attempted to contact Kim Sae Ron for clarification, he found that her number was unavailable. He then criticized her harshly, saying, ""It seems she even deleted her number due to the controversy. She lacks sincerity in her self-reflection and has no sense of responsibility as a celebrity.""

Lee Jin Ho also previously criticized Kim Sae Ron for allegedly drinking while on a self-imposed hiatus after her DUI incident. He questioned whether she was genuinely remorseful, although drinking itself is not an issue, only drinking and driving is. However, he framed the situation as if simply consuming alcohol was inherently wrong.

On February 17, Kwon Young Chan, head of the Korea Celebrity Suicide Prevention Association, who had met with Kim Sae Ron's father, pointed out an ""unnamed YouTuber"" during an interview. Kwon Young Chan stated, ""Kim Sae Ron's father said that his daughter suffered severe emotional distress due to YouTuber A’s videos.""

While the YouTuber was not explicitly named, considering that Lee Jin Ho continuously made speculative criticism about Kim Sae Ron, including ones regarding her wedding-themed photoshoot, and subsequently deleted all related videos, many believe Kwon Young Chan was referring to him.

Lee Jin Ho's channel has been flooded with angry comments demanding an apology. Netizens have left messages such as, ""Are you happy now that Kim Sae Ron is gone?,"" ""Cyberwrecker,"" ""You drove her to death,"" ""Deleting the videos is infuriating,"" and ""Murderer.""

Kwon Young Chan has since stated that if Kim Sae Ron’s family decides to take legal action against YouTuber 'A' or seek mediation through the Press Arbitration Commission, he will offer various forms of free support.

Meanwhile, Kim Sae Ron was found deceased in her Seoul home on February 16 at 4:54 PM. A friend who had planned to meet her discovered her and reported it to the police. Although no suicide note was found, authorities stated during a press briefing on February 17 that they believe she took her own life.

Meghan Markle’s Jam Business Has a New Name - The Cut,Meghan Markle has revamped her lifestyle brand-slash-jam company with a name that is both easier to say and less likely to get her into a patent dispute.,http://www.thecut.com/article/meghan-markle-new-as-ever-lifestyle-brand.html,music,"Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage

Good-bye, American Riviera Orchard. We hardly knew ye. On Monday, Meghan Markle announced that the lifestyle brand she launched last year — which hasn’t done much except send jam to her friends — is getting a revamp. American Riviera Orchard is out, and As Ever is in. Is that a better name? It certainly sounds less like an actor’s diction exercise, so that’s a plus, and it’s far less likely to get her into a patent dispute.

“Last year, I had thought, ‘American Riviera, that sounds like such a great name.’ It’s my neighborhood; it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara, but it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area,” Markle said in an Instagram video, her new favorite way of communicating. The brand relaunch is being paired with the release of Markle’s Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, which comes out in March. Until then, you can bide your time by looking at Markle’s new website, which features nothing but a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, but is frankly much more inviting than the ARO one ever was.

“Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show, but as my partner in my business, which was huge,” Markle continued, “so I thought about it, and I’ve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022, and this is the moment, and it’s called As Ever.”

Markle promised that As Ever will feel familiar to anyone who kept up with her pre-Harry lifestyle blog, The Tig. “If you’ve followed me since 2014 with The Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening — this is what I do,” Markle explained, “I haven’t been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years, but now I can, so as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first.”

This is all very exciting, but one thing about Markle is that she cannot do anything without sending people into a tizzy. It turns out that there’s already a small New York–based clothing brand called As Ever. The brand’s founder, Mark Kolski, wrote on Instagram, “In the last 36 hours there has been an outpouring of support and concern regarding recent events around our namesake brand. We are aware. We are not affiliated.” Kolski’s As Ever has been around since 2015, and he wrote that it will continue on as ever.

Somehow, that wasn’t the only bit of controversy. The new name came with a new logo, which features a palm tree flanked by two hummingbirds. While tabloids speculate those are sweet symbolic nods to her relationship with Prince Harry, one Spanish official thinks Markle stole her town’s seal. “Page Six” reported that Xisca Mora, the mayor of a 5,000-person Mallorcan town called Porreres, is not so touched by Markle’s new logo. Despite the fact that there are some differences — the palm tree looks different, Porreres’s birds are swallows instead of hummingbirds — Mora is “studying the case with the legal services of the Consistory to see what course of action should be taken.” In layman’s terms, she’s deciding if she wants to sue. For once, I’d like to see something go off without a hitch for Markle.

On the positive side of things, Markle promised that her refreshed endeavor will still include fruit preserves. (“Jam is my jam.”) There will also be … other things? Markle remained vague about what the deal is going to be with As Ever but said, “There are so many more products that I just love, and now it’s time to share them with you.” What could that mean? We’ll find out when As Ever launches alongside Markle’s Netflix show in two weeks — but my guess is that it’s, like, scented candles.
