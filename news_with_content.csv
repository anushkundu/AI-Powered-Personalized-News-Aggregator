"Apple’s M5 chip release will remedy an unpopular M4 decision, per report - 9to5Mac","The next-generation M5 chip is expected to debut this fall, and when it does, Apple will reportedly remedy an unpopular M4 decision it made.",https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/18/apples-m5-chip-release-will-remedy-an-unpopular-m4-decision-report/,technology,"Apple’s M4 rollout isn’t yet complete, with the M4 MacBook Air expected to launch soon. But the M5 chip is expected to debut this fall, and when it does, Apple will reportedly remedy an unpopular M4 decision.

M5 chip coming first to the Mac, not Apple’s new iPad Pro

Over the weekend, Mark Gurman reported on the first devices expected to feature Apple’s M5 chip. And in doing so, he identified a key change from the company’s M4 approach.

He writes at Bloomberg:

the M5 chip transition will begin — alongside new MacBook Pro models in the fall. Then we should get an M5 iPad Pro by the first half of 2026. In other words, the M4 and M5 chip transitions will see their release orders flipped, with the M5 coming to the Mac before the iPad Pro.

Last May, Apple surprised many of us by debuting its brand new M4 chip not in a Mac, but in the new iPad Pro.

It then took a full six months before a single Mac gained the new chip.

While iPad Pro users like myself enjoyed getting the latest chip first, it was an especially unpopular move for Mac users. In part, no doubt, because of the long wait for the first M4 Macs to arrive in November.

But with the M5 line this fall, Apple appears to be reversing course and going back to its former strategy of launching new M-class chips on the Mac. In this case, with the new MacBook Pro.

And since the MacBook Pro will be the first M5 device, we should see not only the base M5 chip debut, but also the M5 Pro and M5 Max at the same time—just like what happened with the M3 line in 2023.

Did you take issue with Apple giving iPad Pro the M4 first? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.

Tetris Forever Is Getting Its Own Collectable Handheld Console - Nintendo Life,Digital Eclipse's 'Gold Master Series' Goes Physical,https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/tetris-forever-is-getting-its-own-collectable-handheld-console,technology,"Digital Eclipse has announced that its Gold Master Series will be going physical via publisher Clear River Games, with boxed editions available for The Making of Karateka, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, and Tetris Forever.

The crown jewel of the collection is undoubtedly the collector's edition for Tetris Forever. Priced at $139.99 (€139.99), this will come with its own bespoke handheld unit that will play Tetris (Famicom) and Tetris 2 + BomBliss.

Also included is an exclusive soundtrack CD, tetrimino magnets, woven patches, and a poster. This will all come housed in a fancy modular tetrimino box, and it honestly looks wonderful.

The Making of Karateka and Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter story will also receive special deluxe editions priced at $69.99 (€69.99) each. These will come with unique goodies specially selected for each title, and we're really quite taken with the glasses and bandana in the Llamasoft physical edition. Groovy.

Of course, if you'd rather just own the bog-standard edition of each game, these will be available at $34.99 (€34.99) each. Pre-orders will become available from 25th February 2025 from Atari's website, Limited Run Games, and select retailers internationally.

We're big fans of all three titles from the Gold Master Series so far, awarding The Making of Karateka a score of 8/10, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story a score of 9/10, and Tetris Forever a score of 8/10."
Skater Tyshawn Jones claims to be in upcoming Tony Hawk game remaster - Gematsu,"Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones is in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game remaster, he told Power 105.1 FM’s The Breakfast Club in an interview today.",https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/skater-tyshawn-jones-claims-to-be-in-upcoming-tony-hawk-game-remaster,technology,"Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones is in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game remaster, he told Power 105.1 FM’s The Breakfast Club in an interview today.

When discussing new skateboarding video games, Jones said, “I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that’s cool—they got a new one they’re remastering, so that’s about to come out. I was [also] in the last one [Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2].”

The latest entry in the Tony Hawk video game series, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, launched for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Epic Games Store on September 4, 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on March 26, 2021, Switch on June 25, 2021, and PC via Steam on October 3, 2023.

Back in June 2022, Tony Hawk said that a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 was planned after Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, but plans were shelved after developer Vicarious Visions was absorbed by Blizzard Entertainment. At the time, Hawk said, “I wish there was someway to bring it back. I mean, who knows? Maybe when all the dust settles, we’ll figure it out.”"
Nothing Phone (3a) officially has a 50MP periscope camera in a wild new design [Video] - 9to5Google,"In the lead-up to its next launch, Nothing continues to tease the Phone (3a) series, this time revealing the camera...",http://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/nothing-phone-3a-camera-design-teaser-video/,technology,"In the lead-up to its next launch, Nothing continues to tease the Phone (3a) series, this time revealing the camera specs and teasing the wild design of the rear camera module.

The Nothing Phone (3a) series is set to make its debut in just a couple of weeks, and ahead of that launch, Carl Pei’s company continues to tease what’s coming. This now includes a first look at the Nothing Phone (3a)’s updated cameras, which are now confirmed to include three 50MP sensors and one 8MP shooter.

In a video comparing the camera to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Nothing details that the Phone (3a) will have a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the back. There’s a third 50MP camera on the front for selfies. This is the first Nothing Phone with a telephoto camera lens.

The video goes on to detail various improvements to the Phone (3a)’s camera, including revealing that the periscope lens supports 3x optical zoom, 6x “lossless” zoom, and up to 60x zoom, the latter two using digital zoom to make up the difference. All four cameras support Ultra HDR and the main and front-facing cameras can both shoot 4K video.

In another teaser shared on Twitter/X, Nothing shows off the camera module that contains these camera sensors, and it looks pretty wild. Notably, it’s different from a prior design that leaked which had a design more similar to Pixel. Presumably, this device is the “Plus” or “Pro” variant.

The company also went on to share the full-res sample images, offering our first good look at the camera quality coming from the Nothing Phone (3a) series.

Review: Sid Meier's Civilization VII (Switch) - An Incredible Game That's Not Quite Ready - Nintendo Life,Short of Civilliant,https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sid-meiers-civilization-vii,technology,"Most games with numbered sequels tend to iterate and grow on their previous instalments. After all, you don’t want to alienate your audience by upending key systems and creating a substantially different experience from what they’re used to, it just makes sound economic sense. Change things just enough so that it rides that line between familiarity and shininess.

Firaxis apparently missed this particular industry-wide memo, and thus the Civilization series will happily buck its own trends and well-established ideas in order to deliver something fresh every single time, and that is no less the case with Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, which we’ll be calling ‘Civ 7’ for the sake of our keyboard.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

Let’s be clear, it sticks to the same broad ideas as ever, but tried and trusted mechanics have gone out the window; not because they didn’t work, but because, hey, it’s time to try something different.

As with every game prior, Civ 7 has you take on the role of a real-life world leader – each with their own unique bonuses and quirks – looking to explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate, and coining the ‘4X’ genre presumably named by people with first-letter blindness. In Civ 7 you’re going to need to try and achieve one (or realistically, more than one) of four goals before your opponents, and those four ‘E’s we mentioned earlier are the way to do it.

Simple, right? No, not right. The reality of the game is that there are a staggering number of ways to achieve your chosen goals, each with the potential to be as nuanced and calculated as a well-played game of chess. Or you could go full militaristic and nuke everyone else, declaring yourself the victor by default. However, it’ll be a while before you’ll be able to do so, at least with actual nuclear warheads, because Civ 7 changes the previous progression system by introducing three Ages of humanity.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

You’ll start in Antiquity, which has you start at the literal birth of your new civilisation with nary but a settler to start your very first city. You’ll need to research advanced human technology such as pottery and what to do with animals and systematically work your way through all the major technological advancements of our species. And there’s not much in the way of shortcuts for this, unlike the previous entry in the series. You’re going to have to work for each and every one of these the old-fashioned way, or steal them from your neighbours.

Yes, diplomacy has had potentially the biggest overhaul this time around, mostly requiring you to use the new Influence points to better or intentionally worsen your relationship with the other blossoming nations. You can also actually see your leader as well during these moments, which is a nice touch.

A personal favourite addition to this system is the ability to ‘reject’ a denouncement from a rival, spending hard-earned Influence points to stop a leader from driving a wedge between your people. It’s a small addition, but one that makes a formal war feel more tied to public opinion than simply two leaders having beef. Whether that’s more true-to-life or not is debatable.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

Following the Antiquity Age is the Exploration Age, and the way this change works is a little strange, but oddly refreshing. Your cities and towns remain the same, but you may have some of your units trimmed if you don’t have enough Commanders (oh, we’ll get onto them, don’t you worry) or settlements to house them properly.

It’s not entirely clear how the system works in its entirety, but the units you do keep will be upgraded to Age-appropriate examples. We’re still absolutely gutted that our Purabhettarahs were ‘upgraded’ to mere horses with blokes in the saddle, but apparently war elephants aren’t cool enough to survive into 400CE.

This transition almost feels like a ‘New Game Plus’ moment, where you’re sort of starting anew, sort of not. It helps to bookend each third of the game, and stops one player from potentially blasting a satellite into orbit whilst another is just working out how to make boats not sink. It also gives us the sense we’ve completed a game without having to sacrifice an entire weekend only for Harriet Tubman to go to war with us yet again, distracting King Xerxes from his honest scientific aims.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

But the Exploration Age is all about just that - boats that don’t sink. You’ll be stretching out beyond the confines of your original landmass into the wide unknown, founding distant new settlements and finding exotic resources. In our first run, we didn’t even really check the settings properly due to a sudden lapse in competence and assumed that there were four civilisations on the planet, including our own. Reaching not only another entire continent but two new leaders was honestly kind of magical.

This is hardly a new feature, and we ourselves have already had this happen in previous games, but that moment of barely being able to cross a chunk of deep ocean only to be greeted by two new allies/enemies took us aback more than we expected, and more than it logically should. A really lovely experience.

After that is the Modern Age, where the guns and the tanks roam free. You’ll be digging up relics from the past, trying to win the space race, developing weapons of mass destruction, the whole megillah. Tensions are also higher than ever, forcing even the likes of Confucius into building up armies of dive bombers because Catherine the Great suddenly lost all affection for him.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

In fact, let’s talk about combat for a moment. It is almost certainly possible to play an entirely pacifist game should you be skilled enough, but a player who doesn’t at least build a defensive force is a fool indeed. Alliances can sour quickly if you make the wrong move or don’t have the right number of influence points to make right what’s wrong and, as such, war – if not inevitable – is at least bloody likely.

Previous games in the series had you control each unit individually, and that’s sort of the same case here, except it’s also sort of not, thanks to the unrivalled blessing of Commanders. Commanders can ‘carry’ up to four units (or six, with a promotion) and march them across the land faster and much more effectively than they could on their own. They can’t fight themselves though, they’re purely a support unit.

The end result is that combat and wars are substantially easier to manage and control than in previous games. You’re going to want to make use of them though, as individual units can’t be promoted as before, only Commanders. Their promotion tree can make otherwise weak units far more potent than they have the right to be, guided as they are by a competent admiral/captain/head honcho. It’s a shame we can’t name them, as mowing down Benjamin Franklin’s Roman legion under the banner of the great commander Gromit would be a real point in the game’s favour.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

And no, that wasn’t a mistake, we did say Benjamin Franklin’s Roman legion because leaders are no longer tied to their real-life civilisations. You can mix and match as merrily as you like, or you can keep things clean and historically accurate if you prefer, you’d be missing out though, as certain combinations can produce really beneficial results, or you can pick a somewhat worse combination if you’re looking for a really different run. You can even jump to the later two ages at the very start of a game if you like, skipping all that pesky need to research what rocks are good for. It’s all options, and options are good.

Unfortunately, the Switch version has slightly fewer options when it comes to setting up a game. Map sizes are limited to ‘Tiny’ and ‘Small’, no doubt due to hardware limitations, but considering Civ 6 managed far, far larger map sizes, it’s disappointing that they’re not even an option here.

At least there are efforts to allow crossplay for online games though, right? Right. Unfortunately, our attempts to join an online game were hampered by the fact that other platforms have already had a patch, meaning that the versions of the lobbies we tried to join were incompatible about 95% of the time. Quite irritating.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

We were able to find an appropriate game eventually, though the game immediately crashed upon loading the map. Eventually, we did get a successful match going, but getting there wasn’t so much a headache as a full-blown migraine. It’s a real shame, too, as playing against real people is a much more interesting experience by default.

You’re likely expecting us to now detail how unstable the game is on Nintendo’s hybrid, but in all honesty, it was more reliable than we expected. We had a single crash mid-game in our 30-40 hours playing, although we did happen upon several other crashes at less critical moments, such as loading a saved game or linking a 2K account.

More than this, we’re sad to report that Civilization VII doesn’t really feel as finished as it should. We’ve encountered numerous bugs with duplicate ghosts of units long past just standing on a tile they were once on, music constantly stuttering and cutting out, controls occasionally misbehaving causing us to perform actions we didn’t want to perform, constant reminders that new resources are available to allocate when there absolutely are not any new resources at all, general UI weirdness, the list goes on. None of these are strictly game-breaking, but it's not what anyone wants to see.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

The Civlopedia should also be a slam-dunk in the game’s favour, an in-game resource that tells you how everything works and even provides historical information about nigh-on everything within it, but it’s almost impossible to navigate. Categories seem arbitrary at best, and you can’t even reach the search box without using the touch screen, and even if you do manage to type something in, the actual searching appears to do nothing.

And it could be so useful. This series isn't renowned for its simplicity; there are countless systems and resources to keep track of and understand, which is wonderful in its own right, but it needs to be properly explained to the player, which the Civlopedia could do so easily. There are tutorials for first-time players, but certain aspects are overexplained, and others glossed over.

The Minus button is a dedicated ‘2K Account’ button, allowing you to see who’s online as well as the info of anyone you’re currently playing with. A sensible feature, but one that absolutely doesn’t need to have a dedicated button instead of simply an entry in the pause menu. If this was used to jump to the dedicated Civlopedia page of what you’re highlighting instead, it would be invaluable. As it is, it’s just a confusing bundle of pages.

Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)

Yet despite all these valid criticisms, we could barely pull ourselves away from it. The UI may be wonky in places, but on Switch it’s much cleaner and better scaled than Civ 6’s ballooned offering, particularly when docked. Gwendoline Christie's narration is a delight, the moment-to-moment gameplay and the thrill of a plan coming to fruition is deliciously rewarding, and the bitter taste of defeat successfully makes you loathe the leader that caused it rather than the game itself, which is a very difficult thing to get right.

It’s also brimming with wonderful little details, like a quote calling back to one of Eddie Izzard’s most beloved stand-up routines about flags, a memento that is a real-life stone tablet and one of the earliest examples of human writing complaining about the quality of shipment of copper, a similarly real stone with ‘catch’ engraved upon it, it’s overwhelming fun to anyone with a love of history/prehistory/British standup.

Performance on Switch is a bit mixed. Much like its predecessor, the uncapped frame rate will perform buttery smooth when zoomed right in, reaching up to the maximum of 60, but it's a fool's dream to believe you'll get this during normal gameplay. Generally you're going to expect between 20 and 30 frames a second, varying quite dramatically. Due to the game's turn-based nature this isn't a dealbreaker by any means, and aside from a few wonky models, the game manages to look rather nice, with plenty of detail when zoomed right out."

It's due out this Summer on PC (via Steam). In it, players must defend our planet from Martian extraterrestrial attack by creating ""bizarre and powerful creature-human hybrids"" with the Splice-O-Tron. Examples include the Squirrel-Cow, Human-Rhino, and Cheetah-Fly. Gameplay is inspired by the Nintendo DS classic Advance Wars.

Relic says, ""For decades, Martians have been secretly visiting Earth, abducting humans and animals to harvest their atomic essence. Now, they’ve returned with a full-scale invasion, and it’s up to a ragtag group of commanders to lead Earth’s resistance. Players will command Earth’s military against high-tech Martian saucers, grav-tanks, and elite alien warriors in a desperate struggle for survival.""

Earth vs. Mars includes a 30+ mission single-player campaign, online multiplayer where you can play as either faction, a VS Mode to challenge yourself against the game's AI, and a map editor.

“We are excited to bring a Relic Twist to the Advance Wars style of gameplay, infusing some Relic DNA, while harkening back to some of our earlier titles,” said Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell. “Relic Entertainment recently announced a new strategy: Alongside continuing to work on the traditional RTS titles that we’re known for, we’re also going to work on smaller Indie style games in order to explore new sub-genres, experiment, get our creative juices going, and release games more frequently.” You can wishlist it on Steam if you're interested.

If so I'm waiting. I waited till the US equivalent of $300 not the $400-500 AUD of OG Switch, better battery or OLED and Lite was cheaper sure but not what I was looking for. I'm glad I waited I can barely see text on OG Switch let alone a Switch Lite or DSi compared to the New 3DS XL. I read manga just as small and can still make out what it says just enough. No glasses either. So devs need better scaling not ""TV ONLY BECAUSE WERE TOO LAZY TO PORT PROPERLY AND PUT BETTER TEXT SIZE"".

1080? 1400? what it goes for and other aspects making me wonder really. If justified then sure the price is justified.

So I waited till 2021 to get one cheap. So you bet I'm not paying $500-600 AUD and waiting even longer. I've got plenty of Switch 1 game to still look into anyway let alone retro consoles so I'm good any time to wait.

I don't care for PS5/Series X anyway, others can buy them, I played them once to see what they are like, so PS4/Xbox One (still my least favourite consoles/libraries but I mean it's better than nothing of worth on those consoles with the same game design and more visuals, how boring. Tell me when devs aka programmers/animators/designers actually put effort in, Indies have more then their inspiration/nostalgia and have a brain like the 1% of Indies that do have a brain and create better games or else gaming is just going to be PS3/360 boring and less refined then those were with less staff, better competition, and quality I know I'm buying them and comparing to garbage modern gaming, I know how they feel and how good the gameplay ideas are then nowadays being so empty, bland and worthless) has been fine till devs wake up and push gameplay first not everything else first and waste my time. I'm 1 purchase they don't care about me anyway.

I've played PS2/PSP/Wii/DS versions before and had way more fun on many (some are misses, but most are hits) then PS3/360 versions so I'm good, parity and garbage game design doesn't get a pass. Weak hardware is not the problem, art style and level design/mechanics/movesets and execution are.

Nintendo/some devs have tried but even Pikmin 4 was so boring and core design/additions some I liked, most I hated. Pikmin 1 with New Play Control or 3 on Wii U were better. 4 was terrible in tweaks to the formula besides the repeated caves of 2 and new ones. Night mode good, motion controls restrictive and I never used but wanted to. Other eh upgrades/things. Oatchi can't swim till 5 days in.... Why?"
Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy crossover first cards revealed - Eurogamer,"Wizards of the Coast has unveiled the first four of its forthcoming Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy cards, and confi…",https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-first-cards-revealed,technology,"Wizards of the Coast has unveiled the first four of its forthcoming Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy cards, and confirmed legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.

The Final Fantasy crossover will launch on 13th June and consists of four decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14. It's the lead card from each of these decks that's now been revealed: Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.

Each deck will consist of 100 cards, including both reprints of existing cards with new Final Fantasy art and brand new cards, and will tell the story of that particular Final Fantasy game.

""Final Fantasy games are so rich with flavor, beloved characters, and unique settings that choosing a single game as the theme provided more than enough material to design a full deck of cards around,"" Magic's senior game designer Daniel Holt told IGN. ""Approaching each deck as a single game also provided the opportunity to dive deep into the lore of each, capturing even more beloved moments from across the game's storyline that we may not have been able to achieve otherwise.""

Holt said the development team has ""so many passionate Final Fantasy fans"", with the four games partially chosen because they're favourites among the team. However, each brought its own unique challenges in adaptation. For instance, how will the Final Fantasy 7 deck balance the original game with its Remake trilogy?

""Our core approach to Final Fantasy 7 was to capture the original PS1 game's narrative, while using Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's modern aesthetics to push the fidelity of each character design, story moment, and memorable location to the next level,"" said principal narrative game designer Dillon Deveney. ""With that in mind, if a scene existed in both games, we had our choice of showing it as the original game did, how the modern version interpreted it, or a unique fusion of both. Hopefully, this deck feels familiar and nostalgic to players of both the original game and the modern series!""

And while each deck has the lead character from each game as its Commander, Final Fantasy 14 is an MMORPG without an equivalent lead.

""For Y'shtola, it came down to a mix of popularity of the character as well as being a spellcaster, her story and character development offered a wide range of abilities and moments to pull from to lead the deck,"" said Holt, adding the deck specifically reflects her story arc in expansion Shadowbringers.

Meanwhile, the official Magic: The Gathering account stated the crossover has ""brought together esteemed artists from around the world"" - and confirmed legendary Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.

We couldn't do #MTGxFINALFANTASY without going back to the beginning and working with an artist who inspired generations of #FinalFantasy fans.



Tune in tomorrow to WeeklyMTG to see more from this set! Tuesday, 10am Pacific, https://t.co/nUzYF5lf0v pic.twitter.com/DAA0uGMeDX — Magic: The Gathering (@wizards_magic) February 17, 2025 To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings

More details on the crossover are expected later today, with a reveal on the Magic: The Gathering Twitch channel at 10am PT (that's 6pm UK time).

All four decks will be available individually as a regular version (MSRP $69.99) or as a collector's edition (MSRP $149.99).

iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to Feature Same OLED Panel as Last Year's Pro Models - MacRumors,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel,...",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-air-to-use-samsung-m4-panel/,technology,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel, according to the Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital.



Samsung's ""M"" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while ""14"" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. The ""M14"" panel was used in last year's Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models, and delivers a 30% increase in brightness along with improved longevity compared to the previous M13 panel, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of the blue-emitting layer.

Oddly, Samsung's latest Galaxy S25 Ultra uses an improved version of the older M13 panel, so it looks like the regular iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could well have an objectively better display in at least some respects.

Apple's use of the M14 panel for all models makes sense, as Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone 17 models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only ""Pro"" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature.

Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.

Last year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌iPhone‌ model, while the iPhone 17 Air – replacing the Plus model – is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max."
"Epic Games sues Fortnite cheater, takes back winnings and forces them to post humiliating public apology video as a stark warning to others - Eurogamer",,https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others,technology,"Epic Games has made an example out of Fortnite cheater RepulseGod, real name Morgan Bamford, who tried to scam their way to the top of a multi-million dollar tournament.

Details of Epic Games' action were announced by the company last night, alongside the posting of a humiliating public apology video by Bamford where he acknowledged he cheated and confirms he is now banned from Fortnite tournaments for life.

In a statement, Epic Games said it sued Bamford when it emerged he had shared his account with a friend to qualify for the FNCS 2023 Global Championship - Fortnite's biggest tournament, which that year held a $4m prize pool.

""We took legal action against a player who shared their account to unfairly qualify for FNCS,"" Epic Games wrote, in a message posted to its Fortnite Competitive social media account. ""Now they're banned from Fortnite tournaments forever and their undeserved prize money was donated to charity.""

Exactly how much Bamford lost is unclear, though in the qualifying legs for the tournament it's likely he earned thousands of dollars.

Bamford's public apology video, now public on his YouTube channel, reveals he had to pay a ""monetary settlement, which included the money I received but did not win fairly, which Epic will donate to charity"".

That charity, as chosen by Epic Games, is Child's Play - an organisation which aids children with access to games and specialist gaming equipment.

Late last year, Epic Games said it was ""ramping up legal action against both players who cheat and cheat sellers"", as it sought to bolster ""competitive integrity in tournaments"".

Bamford's public punishment, loss of money and apology video are all clearly designed to deter others from doing the same.

""Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments and I apologise to the Fortnite community for my actions,"" Bamford's apology video concludes. ""I wont [sic] ever cheat in Fortnite again.""

Fortnite will next be collaborating with Mortal Kombat, ahead of the battle royale game's fresh season that will also star a crime-loving pickle."
The OnePlus Watch 3 finally adds a proper rotating crown - The Verge,"The $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 improves battery life to five days, while adding Wear OS 5, dual-frequency GPS, and several new health features.",https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables,technology,"is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

I’ve had the $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 for a few days, and so far, this isn’t an Android watch that flips the script. Instead, it’s a story about refinement (and playing a bit of catch-up), rather than pushing boundaries. And you know what? If it means a strong Google / Samsung alternative with a rotating crown that finally scrolls, I’m totally fine with that.

On the design front, the Watch 3 is quite similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, with a few key changes. The OLED display is a smidge larger and brighter at 2,200 nits, and the bezels are notably smaller, though that’s partially because of a slight design tweak. The screen is spiffy to look at, especially with the new video watchface where you can upload your own clips. (I, of course, have uploaded one of my cat asking for belly rubs.) The casing is still stainless steel, but there’s a new titanium physical bezel, too. It gives it a more classic analog look, but otherwise, this isn’t a dramatic change. My big design gripe is that the Watch 3 still only comes in a single 47mm size. It’s not horrible, but I have smaller wrists, and the lug gaps are notable. Offering just one size excludes folks with smaller wrists from comfortably using the Watch 3, and that feels like a missed opportunity.

I’ll forgive OnePlus this oversight now that there’s a proper rotating crown. This time, you can actually use it to scroll through screens — a baffling omission from the last watch. There are delightful haptics that go along with it, and while this isn’t a groundbreaking addition, it soothes my inner curmudgeon that OnePlus has seen the errors of its ways and now upholds the nerdy wearable covenant that a rotating crown must also scroll.

Battery life has also been improved from 100 hours to 120 hours — or five days with regular use and the always-on display turned off. Turning on the AOD shortens that to roughly three days. That’s fairly typical for all flagship smartwatches these days. In a power-saving mode, you can get up to 16 days. OnePlus says it’s managed to stuff a larger 631mAh battery in the Watch 3 using the same silicon nanostack battery as the OnePlus 13. Since it runs Wear OS 5, that should add some extra battery mileage. I haven’t been testing the watch long enough to definitively comment on battery life just yet, but I always appreciate faster charging. You can get a full day’s worth in about 10 minutes.

OnePlus says it changed the sensor layout and made tweaks to the materials to improve tracking accuracy. Speaking of sensors, the Watch 3 adds one for wrist temperature, an eight-channel optical heart rate sensor, and a 16-channel blood oxygen sensor. It’s also revamped the GPS with a “circular polarized antenna,” which it claims will help improve GPS maps in areas with tall buildings. I’m getting over a cold, so I haven’t had the chance to test this on a run yet, but I’ll see whether it makes a dramatic difference. Technically, the Watch 3 can also take EKGs, but that functionality won’t be available for users in the US or Canada. In a briefing, OnePlus spokesperson Spenser Blank said that’s because OnePlus hasn’t received FDA clearance but that, for “business reasons,” the company doesn’t plan on pursuing FDA clearance.

That’s disappointing given some of the new health features. The big one is OnePlus’ 60S Health Check-In, where you touch the side button and get a quick scan of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. European users will get EKGs included in Q2 2025. Also new is a vascular health test, which measures your arterial stiffness. It’s similar to a feature Oura introduced last year, and it’s meant to gauge your circulatory system’s overall state. (Mine is “normal.”)

Truly rude. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge Not sure what I’m supposed to feel about my moderate wellness. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge

With the Watch 3, OnePlus is refocusing a bit on sleep tracking and wellness. The company says sleep tracking has been overhauled, and you’ll now be able to use the watch to track snoring patterns to assess your breathing disruptions. Stress tracking has also been rebranded as “360 Mind and Body,” and it uses heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and activity intensity to approximate how you’re doing… with emoji. Depending on how it evaluates your stress, you might get recommendations for guided breathing. I’ve been running a beta version of the OHealth app with these updates, and so far, I have received more insights into sleep tracking — though I’m not entirely sold on the emoji. So far, all I’ve been is roasted for my “moderate” wellness.

A lot of these updates are things other competitors already have. They just have a OnePlus twist to them, and it’ll take me some more time to really put subtler software tweaks through the testing gauntlet. So far, though, wearing the Watch 3 is a pleasant reminder of how OnePlus has surprisingly emerged as a competitive alternative to Samsung and Google. But one change I know I don’t love is the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive than its predecessor — though Blank told me that the price increase has nothing to do with tariffs.

The OnePlus Watch 3 is available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on February 25th."
Nintendo Switch's Excellent Gold Points Scheme Is Being Discontinued - Kotaku,"From next month, we'll no longer earn 5 percent of our purchases back on the Switch eStore",https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points-loyalty-scheme-1851765041,technology,"Nintendo has announced, with no explanation as to why, that it will be discontinuing Nintendo Gold Points on March 24. The scheme awarded points when buying both physical and digital editions of games, which could then be redeemed as currency on future eShop purchases. But, ahead of the (still unknown) launch date of the Switch 2, they will no longer be awarded.

Nintendo’s Gold Points scheme is excellent. You earn back five percent of the amount you spend on games as this store currency, which can then be used to get money off further purchases on the eShop. So if you spent $60 on a new title, you’d usually receive $3 into your account. Which might not sound like a huge amount, until the next time you’re browsing the store to look at indie games on sale and realize you can have the one that takes your eye for free! It makes buying things on the Nintendo console store feel directly rewarding, in contrast to the more intangible offers from Microsoft of Sony.

Which makes it really odd that it’s coming to an end. Gold Points you already have will continue to work as before—they’re valid for 12 months after you receive them, and you’ll still be able to use them for discounts until the last possible date, March 24, 2026. You can also still receive them until that March 24, 2025 date, on any digital or physical purchases you make. Further, physical games published ahead of the deadline will still be redeemable, even after March 24.

There’s no information regarding whether Gold Points will be redeemable against Switch 2 games on that device’s store. We’ve contacted Nintendo to try to find out more.

Nintendo’s announcement of the ending of the scheme states, “We thank you for supporting the My Nintendo Rewards program, and hope you will continue to enjoy the other features of the program.” As if it’s some sort of unavoidable event, rather than a corporate decision.

Alongside this, Nintendo has made clear that the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme won’t work for Switch 2 games. This was a separate money saver for Nintendo Switch Online users, which let you cbuy two big-name games at a discounted price.

Obviously, this is all timed ahead of the launch of the Switch 2, expected some time perhaps in May or June of this year. But it remains deeply strange, given that the Switch 1 will have a long tail and its eStore will remain online and updated with new games for years to come.

It could be—in fact it’s extremely likely—that Nintendo will announce a whole new loyalty scheme for the Switch 2, and is looking to reset everything ahead of that. But unless original Switch users will also gain the benefits, it’ll be a huge bummer. It’s also extremely odd that any of this is happening before the Switch 2 launches. Nintendo may well have plans for something even better, but if so, there would surely be a better way to go about announcing things.

Once their expiry date arrives next month, you won't be able to play any of these games via the PS Plus service anymore — even if you've downloaded or redeemed them. You'll need to buy a copy to continue playing.

The good thing about this list is none of the PS5, PS4 titles are of any real length. The longest game here is Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, at around 25 hours for the main story.

DJI’s new Osmo Mobile 7 Pro has so very many tricks up its sleeve - The Verge,"DJI’s just-announced $149 Osmo Mobile 7 Pro is the most feature-packed spin on smartphone gimbals yet, with a pop-out tripod and tracking camera.",https://www.theverge.com/news/614181/dji-osmo-mobile-7-pro-smartphone-gimbal-announcement-price-release-date,technology,"is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

Personally, I can’t imagine using my smartphone as a baby steadicam anymore now that I have DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 — we saw it everywhere at CES 2025, and its one-inch-type sensor offers image quality beyond what today’s smartphones allow.

But if you like the idea of sticking your phone into a set of stabilized motors on a stick, DJI’s just-announced $149 Osmo Mobile 7 Pro is the most feature-packed spin on the idea I’ve ever touched.

Now you can plop your selfie-stick down onto a surface with a new built-in tripod, pull eight inches of telescoping arm out of the top to give it reach, then snap on a new “Multifunctional Module” with a built-in computer vision camera to automatically track you, start and stop filming, and adjust framing, just by gesturing with your hands.

The Multifunctional Module unlocks other neat tricks too: it’s got a built-in fill light with adjustable color temperature that you can turn on by holding down the OM7 Pro’s side dial, and it’s a receiver for DJI’s excellent wireless microphones, including the DJI Mic Mini. It gets wirelessly powered right through DJI’s smartphone clamp thanks to a set of spring-loaded pogo pins, and you can attach it facing either direction if you want the assist for your phone’s selfie camera.

Perhaps most importantly, the module could dramatically reduce your need to use DJI’s app for filming. Previous gimbals required it for tracking, but historically it’s not always played nice with the newest camera features that smartphone makers offer. Now you can use your phone’s built-in camera app and still have it follow you autonomously. (DJI says its own Mimo app does now play nicer with the multi-lens switching, 4K60 recording and electronic image stabilization on more Android phones, but it’s more futureproof this way.)

The module can attach the other way too. Image: DJI

The module’s tracking definitely works in my early tests, though the Multifunctional Module does get a bit hot — as it warns right on the module’s side. It’s also a bit of a battery drain. While DJI has upsized the battery to 12.06 watt-hours and quotes an upgraded 10 hours of battery life, the module cuts it in half to five hours with tracking, or four hours with tracking and the fill light on. (The Osmo Mobile 6’s 7.74Wh pack promised up to 6.5 hours, for comparison.)

I also like that the Osmo Mobile 7P still has a 1/4-inch tripod screw hole in addition to its built-in tripod, so you can mount it to other things, and you can still top up your phone from its USB-C port. I’m especially pleased to say that DJI will start selling a magnetic quick-release adapter so you can plop phones directly onto the gimbal instead of having to stretch apart a clamp — though that adapter won’t be compatible with the Multifunctional Module, and unlike that module, it won’t generally come in the box.

As far as I’m concerned, DJI’s own Osmo Pocket 3 sucked the air out of the room for smartphone gimbals, except in those cases where it’s easier to justify the $150 purchase for an existing phone instead of dropping $520 for better quality or because your iPhone workflow demands it. But I have to admit I’m jealous of the Osmo Mobile’s new tricks. Maybe DJI could make an Osmo Pocket 4 with a telescoping gimbal, pop-out tripod, and hand gestures?

The Pocket 3 ditched most of the Pocket and Pocket 2’s modular parts, proving that modularity wasn’t that product line’s real superpower, and I don’t think pocketability is necessarily it either. I think it’s having an ultra-steady camera that’s better and more versatile than today’s phones while still fitting into a shoulder bag, and I’d welcome even more of that versatility.

In addition to the $149 Osmo Mobile 7P, the company’s also announcing a new budget $89 Osmo Mobile 7 that comes in white rather than black. It also has the pull-out tripod, but ditches the telescoping selfie-stick, doesn’t come with the Multifunctional Module in the box, and doesn’t have the side dial to easily turn on the fill light and adjust focus or zoom.

Microsoft isn’t automatically keeping you signed in to your account just yet - The Verge,Microsoft says notification about account changes were a mistake. The changes to automatic sign-in aren’t happening in February.,https://www.theverge.com/news/614238/microsoft-account-automatic-sign-in-delay,technology,"is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.

Microsoft was planning to make some changes to the way you sign in to a Microsoft account in February, keeping accounts signed in automatically unless you sign out or use private browsing. While the changes were communicated to Outlook.com users through a notification and in a now-removed Microsoft support article, Microsoft has now confirmed to The Verge that this was a mistake.

“There will be no changes to Microsoft users’ commercial (Microsoft Entra) or consumer (Microsoft account) sign in experiences in February,” confirms Alex Simons, corporate vice president of identity & network access program management at Microsoft, in a statement to The Verge. “Media reports were based on incomplete information mistakenly published by a Microsoft product team. The incorrect notifications have been removed.”

Microsoft hasn’t clarified when it plans to eventually roll out these changes after the mistaken notifications, but once they arrive it means you’ll no longer be asked if you want to stay signed in, and Microsoft will automatically keep you signed in instead.

Once Microsoft starts to automatically keep you signed in you’ll have to use a private browsing window on public PCs or make sure you remember to sign out once your session ends, otherwise the account will remain signed in."

DALLAS — For the first time in 53 years, Southwest Airlines is undergoing mass layoffs.

The Dallas-based company will lay off over 1,000 people, or one out of seven employees, at its corporate headquarters.

The unprecedented move comes amid a gigantic shakeup at one of North Texas's biggest employers. Steve Cosgrove, publisher of Airways magazine, said employees were struggling to cope with the uncertainty after layoffs were announced.

""I mean they were crying, their voices were breaking over the phone because they don't know if it's going to be the one-year employee or the 38-year employee that's going to get laid off,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's really shattered the culture there.""

The layoffs will not impact customer-facing and union roles such as flight attendants, pilots and gate agents, so customers may not immediately notice a change, Cosgrove said. Union employees being insulated from the layoffs has created an ""us versus them"" dynamic at headquarters, Cosgrove said.

""Some of the headquarters people feel that part of these layoffs was because of the raises the pilots and flight attendants got, which isn't true because they went without contracts for years,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's set up an us versus them situation in a company that was always all for one, one for all.""

The airline hopes to cut $500 million in expenses as the company works to become more profitable, Cosgrove said. The layoffs will only cut about half that goal amount, he said.

""I don't know how they do the other $200 million, maybe through improved efficiencies and stuff like that,"" Cosgrove said. ""This is such a cold and calculated corporate-type move that Southwest is not known for and the employees aren't used to, so it really did stun them when the email came out yesterday.""

One set of employees may be particularly affected by the layoffs, Cosgrove said. So-called ""love couples"" who met while working at Southwest, got married and continued working for the airline."
Stock futures rise to kick off a shortened trading week: Live updates - CNBC,"Investors, shrugging off ongoing concerns around trade and inflation, are searching for the next catalyst to send stocks higher.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html,business,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 13, 2025.

The S&P 500 closed at a record high Tuesday after stocks rallied seconds before the closing bell, as investors shook off headwinds on the global trade and inflation fronts.

The broad market index gained 0.24% to a record close of 6,129.58, after touching an intraday record of 6,129.63 before the final bell. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.07% at 20,041.26, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10 points, or 0.02%, to finish the session at 44,556.34.

Energy was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, rising 1.9%. Halliburton and Valero Energy led the advance. Tech stocks also ticked higher.

That said, pullbacks about 1% in consumer discretionary and 1.2% for communication services weighed on the broader market. Meta Platforms closed down 2.7% and snapped a 20-day winning streak.

""Overall, the market is still trying to break out of the consolidation it's been in since early December,"" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. ""This week kicks off the retail portion of earnings season, but news out of Washington, especially on the tariff front, could continue to be a wild card for the markets.""

Wall Street is coming off a winning week for the major averages. The Dow gained roughly 0.6% last week, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. The Nasdaq rose 2.6%.

Much of last week's advance came Thursday after President Donald Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs on countries with levies on U.S. goods soothed investors who worried the tariffs would be more stringent.

Stocks have been choppy to start the year. Investors have paid close attention to inflation data, hoping that it will continue to ease and keep the Federal Reserve on its path toward lowering rates.

""I think there's a not-zero chance that the Federal Reserve reverses course next year as inflation becomes a 2026 story,"" said Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. ""That's not being reflected in asset values at the present time. I'm more optimistic than I am pessimistic, but I think we also need to be realistic.""

Correction: The S&P 500 Index closed at a record high on Tuesday. An earlier blog post headline incorrectly described the close."

"Intel Stock Jumps Following Fresh Reports of Possible Broadcom, TSMC Deals - Investopedia","Shares of Intel jumped on Tuesday morning, the first day of trading since new reports emerged over the weekend that the chipmaker is the center of acquisition talks once again.",https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-jumps-following-fresh-reports-of-possible-broadcom-tsmc-deals-11681284,business,"Key Takeaways Intel shares rose Tuesday morning following reports over the weekend that competitors Broadcom and TSMC are considering bids for the chipmaker.

Broadcom's bid would focus on Intel's chip design services, while TSMC is considering a deal for its factories.

The reports follow months of similar speculation as Intel shares slumped in 2024 amid a troubled turnaround plan.

Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped on Tuesday morning, the first day of trading since new reports emerged over the weekend that the chipmaker is the center of acquisition talks once again.

Chip designer Broadcom (AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), the biggest chipmaker in the world, are each in the early stages of considering bids that could see the American chipmaker be broken up, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom is considering a bid for Intel's chip design business, while TSMC is focused on a deal for the manufacturing side, though it would be complex and expensive to refit Intel's factories to make chips the way TSMC usually does, the unnamed sources told the Journal.



Investopedia has not confirmed the report. Intel, Broadcom, and TSMC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.



Reports of possible deals with competitors were one of the few things that lifted Intel stock amid a difficult 2024 that saw shares decline some 60%. The year ended with CEO Pat Gelsinger's departure following a lackluster turnaround effort and reports of possible acquisition bids by competitors.

Tech Leaders Had Meeting With Xi

BABA stock was lifted higher a day after co-founder Jack Ma was one of over 20 tech titans who were invited to a meeting in the capital Beijing with President Xi. This was notable as despite being a supporter of private business in his first few years as leader Xi has in recent times favored the development of state enterprises. He has called on private companies to follow his theme of “common prosperity” in which they should share the fruits of their success with the people. This has led to a cooling down in the ambition and confidence of private firms with Ma largely withdrawing from public life after he faced severe criticism for a speech in 2020 where he blasted state regulators.

However, it seems that Xi, responding to U.S. advancements in AI technology, the state of the Chinese economy and tariffs pressure from President Trump has changed course.

Xi Promises to Remove “Obstacles”

At yesterday’s meeting, which also saw invites to Tencent’s (TCEHY) boss Pony Ma, BYD’s (BYDDY) Wang Chuanfu, Meituan’s Wang Xing, Xiaomi Corp chief Lei Jun, Wang Xingxing of robotics startup Unitree, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, and Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xi urged the leaders to “maintain their competitive spirit.” As reported by Reuters Xi said the tech titans should have confidence in the country’s future stating that the challenges they faced were “temporary.” He promised to abolish unreasonable fees or fines against private firms and level the competitive playing field with state-owned firms. Indeed, yesterday China’s parliament said it would review laws centered on promoting the private economy.

“It is necessary to resolutely remove all kinds of obstacles to the equal use of production factors and fair participation in market competition,” Xi told the entrepreneurs. “Beijing should continue to make great efforts to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for private enterprises.” Although unlikely to let private firms have the freedom they enjoyed pre-2020, more state support would be a positive boost to their investment plans and signal an increased challenge to U.S. rivals.

Is BABA a Good Stock to Buy?

On TipRanks, BABA has a Strong Buy consensus based on 7 Buy and 1 Hold rating. Its highest price target is $151. BABA stock’s consensus price target is $129.13 implying an 3.53% upside.

Delta jet flips upside down on a snowy Toronto runway and all 80 aboard survive - The Associated Press,"A Delta Airlines plane flipped upon arrival at Toronto’s Pearson Airport and ended up on its roof Monday, injuring 17 people.",https://apnews.com/article/delta-toronto-airport-minneapolis-4ab235ef49b2d3757c9bd5fd8c6606ce,business,"TORONTO (AP) — A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto’s Pearson Airport, but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries, the airport’s chief executive said.

Snow blown by winds gusting to 40 mph (65 kph) swirled when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it’s not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down.

Peter Carlson, a passenger traveling to Toronto for a paramedics conference, said the landing was “very forceful.”

“All the sudden everything just kind of went sideways and then next thing I know it’s kind of a blink and I’m upside down still strapped in,” he told CBC News.

Canadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned, the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac.

“We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,” Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement that “the hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected.”

Toronto Pearson Fire Chief Todd Aitken said 18 passengers were taken to the hospital. Earlier in the day, Ornge air ambulance said it was transporting one pediatric patient to Toronto’s SickKids hospital and two injured adults to other hospitals in the city.

A Delta Airlines plane flipped upon arrival at Toronto’s Pearson Airport and ended up on its roof Monday.

Emergency personnel reached the plane within a few minutes and Aitken said the response “went as planned.” He said “the runway was dry and there was no cross-wind conditions.”

The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in the past three weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And on Feb. 6, 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska.

The last major crash at Pearson was on Aug. 2, 2005, when an Airbus A340 landing from Paris skidded off the runway and burst into flames amid stormy weather. All 309 passengers and crew aboard Air France Flight 358 survived the crash.

On Monday, Pearson was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 32 mph (51 kph) gusting to 40 mph (65 kph), according to the Meteorological Service of Canada. The temperature was about 16.5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 degrees Celsius).

The Delta flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. Audio recordings show the control tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow “bump” on the approach.

“It sounds to me like a controller trying to be helpful, meaning the wind is going to give you a bumpy ride coming down, that you’re going to be up and down through the glide path,” said John Cox, CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.

“So it was windy. But the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that,” Cox said. “The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that.”

The plane came to a rest at the intersection of Runways 23 and 15L, not far from the start of the runway. Just after the crash, tower controllers spoke with the crew of a medical helicopter that had just left Pearson and was returning to help.

“Just so you’re aware, there’s people outside walking around the aircraft there,” a controller said.

“Yeah, we’ve got it. The aircraft is upside down and burning,” the medical helicopter pilot responded.

Carlson was among those outside the aircraft. He said when he took off his seat belt he crashed onto the ceiling, which had become the floor. He smelled gas, saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew he needed to get out but said his fatherly intuition and paramedic skills kicked in. He looked for those he could help.

Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her young son out of the plane and then Carlson dropped onto the tarmac. Snow was blowing and it “felt like I was stepping onto tundra.”

“I didn’t care how cold it was, didn’t care how far I had to walk, how long I had to stand — all of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,” he said.

Cox, who flew for U.S. Air for 25 years and has worked on U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigations, said the CRJ-900 aircraft is a proven aircraft that’s been in service for decades and does a good job of handling inclement weather.

He said it’s unusual for a plane to end up on its roof.

“We’ve seen a couple of cases of takeoffs where airplanes have ended up inverted, but it’s pretty rare,” Cox said.

Among the questions that need to be answered, Cox said, is why the crashed plane was missing its right wing.

“If one wing is missing, it’s going to have a tendency to roll over,” he said. “Those are going to be central questions as to what happened to the wing and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. They will be found, if not today, tomorrow, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada will read them out and they will have a very good understanding of what actually occurred here.”

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the Transportation Safety Board of Canada would head up the investigation and provide any updates. The NTSB in the U.S. said it was sending a team to assist in the Canadian investigation.

Endeavor Air, based in Minneapolis, is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines and the world’s largest operator of CRJ-900 aircraft. The airline operates 130 regional jets on 700 daily flights to over 126 cities in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, according to the company’s website.

The CRJ-900, a popular regional jet, was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. It’s in the same family of aircraft as the CRJ-700, the type of plane involved in the midair collision near Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29.

Thames Water secures £3bn lifeline after court ruling - BBC.com,The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of money by the end of March.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7z7ddmd5eo,business,"Thames Water secures £3bn lifeline after court ruling

21 hours ago Michael Race Business reporter, BBC News

Thames Water has won a crucial High Court battle to secure a £3bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the debt-laden company coming under government control. The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running. The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with £19bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed. Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.

The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration. Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal. The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained ""subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected"". Thames has said the £3bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors. But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly. In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the ""relevant alternative"" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime. ""After taking into account the public interest in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of vital public services, I nevertheless exercise my discretion to sanction the plan,"" he said. He also added that Ofwat and the Environment Secretary had ""not opposed the plan"".

The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a ""positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring"" and avoided ""billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers"". However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so. The group had argued an alternative ""B plan"" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling. ""Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,"" a spokesperson said.

'Good money after bad'

Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague said the ruling marked a ""significant milestone"" for the company while chief executive Chris Weston said it put ""our business on a firmer financial footing"". However, Charlie Maynard, Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, said he would appeal against the decision. The politician, who gave a witness statement to the High Court opposing the loan, said: ""Allowing Thames Water to take on £3bn more debt is not in the interests of their millions of customers"". Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a ""sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout""."

Thousands protest Elon Musk’s DOGE in NYC on Presidents’ Day - TechCrunch,"More than 10,000 protesters gathered in New York City on Presidents' Day to speak out against the current Trump administration and the actions in",https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/thousands-protest-elon-musks-doge-in-nyc-on-presidents-day/,business,"More than 10,000 protesters gathered in New York City on Presidents’ Day to speak out against the current Trump administration and the actions in particular of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

It was one of several protests that took place Monday in major cities across the country and came during the same long weekend that smaller protests sprouted up at Tesla dealerships across the country.

Protesters who spoke to TechCrunch from Washington Square Park raised concerns about DOGE’s access to sensitive data of millions of Americans and the group’s dismantling of federal agencies. They said that they view Musk’s work with DOGE as a veiled attempt at a financial power grab, and expressed frustration that Musk, an unelected official, has gained unprecedented levels of power over the federal government.

“I think it’s extremely dangerous that [Musk] has access to our personal data,” Dmitri, 53, an architect who asked that his last name not be used, told TechCrunch. “He’s kind of a futurist fanboy who’s basically living in a sci-fi fantasy and trying to implement that, and has the resources to do mass amounts of damage. He’s tinkering with something that he doesn’t have the ability to actually understand.”

A 55-year-old retired teacher who identified himself only as Tom and who held a sign that read: “No one voted for Musk,” told TechCrunch, “As much as I dislike the fact that a significant number of Americans voted for Trump, it is absolutely the case that no one voted for Musk.”

Tom noted that he didn’t believe the average MAGA supporter voted for Musk and worried that DOGE’s cuts would hurt Americans on a state, local, and individual level.

“The consolidation of power under billionaires is a frightening thing,” he said.

Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to create DOGE, giving Musk, the billionaire owner of SpaceX, Tesla, X, and other companies, the reins to root out government fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars.

Since then, DOGE has fired nearly 10,000 federal workers who handled everything from managing federal lands to caring for military veterans. Another 75,000 workers have accepted the Trump administration’s buyout proposal, which in late January offered federal workers eight months’ pay and benefits to leave their posts if they resigned in early February. DOGE has also cut 104 government contracts related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Trump also granted Musk’s DOGE team access to the Treasury department’s digital payments system, which controls trillions of dollars in payments to Americans, from Social Security benefits to tax refunds, despite questions about their security clearances, their cybersecurity practices, and the legality of Musk’s activities.

Supporters of Trump and Musk applaud their on-paper efforts to root out corruption, inefficiency, and red tape. Opponents object to the way DOGE is going about its stated goals, and warn that the team’s actions will lead to more corruption and national security risks.

A wave of legal challenges has followed that allege a lack of transparency and data privacy violations.

The protesters in New York started at Union Square and marched to Washington Square Park, congregating under the iconic memorial arch dedicated to George Washington, the nation’s first president. They chanted “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go,” and held signs that touted a range of causes, but Musk and DOGE were a common theme throughout.

The New York Police Department estimated the number of attendees to be more than 10,000.

Victoria, who identified herself as a 37-year-old teacher, held a sign that read: “Stop the coup,” echoing comments made to The Guardian on Monday by Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, who told told the outlet, “In the U.S., we appeal rulings we disagree with – we don’t ignore court orders or threaten judges with impeachment just because we don’t like the decision. This is a coup, plain and simple.”

“This is not about us disagreeing with Republican policies,” said Victoria, bundled up against the cold winds whipping through the city, where though sunny, temperatures hovered around 32 degrees Fahrenheit. “It’s the fact that Trump has handed over the power of the purse to Elon Musk, who is unelected.”

As people played music and shouted chants, their homemade signs raised over their heads, a 39-year-old small business owner who identified himself as Corwin said of Musk, “he’s so conflicted and it’s so clear that his antiregulatory attitudes benefit him personally and financially.”

Musk has targeted several agencies for reduction or dismantling that regulate industries in which his companies operate. Earlier this month, Musk said he wants to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which would regulate X’s planned expansion to financial services, posting on his social network X “CFPB RIP,” punctuated with a tombstone emoji. He has stated an intention to go after the Federal Aviation Administration, an agency he’s clashed with before and one that regulates SpaceX. He has also called for ending a rule that requires automakers to report crashes when autonomous driving technology is engaged.

Musk’s actions at the federal level have affected Tesla’s brand image. During the automaker’s 2024 fourth-quarter earnings, analyst Thomas Monteiro of Investing.com noted that the hype around Tesla is trending downward due to, among other things, “severe brand devaluation.”

Stories are cropping up of people selling their Teslas out of a desire to no longer support Musk’s businesses. Some Cybertruck owners have reported instances of vandalism and harassment. The automaker’s sales, which were already beginning to suffer due to increased competition in the market and a stale lineup, have begun to plummet in Europe after a gesture by Musk, at the president’s inauguration, was interpreted by many as a Nazi salute. Poland’s sports and tourism minister Slawomir Nitras lobbied for a Tesla boycott, and in Germany, several companies have cut ties with Tesla in reaction to Musk’s support both for Trump and the far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD)."

Novak Djokovic says recent doping cases in tennis suggest ‘favoritism’ and are ‘not a good image for our sport’ - CNN,Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system as several players speak out in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/sport/novak-djokovic-jannik-sinner-doping-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,sports,"CNN —

Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.

On Saturday, it had emerged that world No. 1 Sinner accepted a ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) from February 9 until May 4 to settle a case which had lingered over tennis for months after the 2025 Australian Open winner twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol in March last year.

He previously avoided suspension when the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced in August that he wasn’t at fault for the positive tests, but WADA later lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

That led to Sinner’s ongoing ban being announced last week, but the three-time grand slam champion will still be eligible to compete at the French Open, the next grand slam on the tennis calendar.

“It’s not a good image for our sport, that’s for sure,” Djokovic told a news conference ahead of his first-round match at the Qatar Open.

“I would say a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room – not just in the last few days but also the last few months – are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.

“The majority of the players don’t feel that it’s fair. The majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. And it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.”

Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, British tennis player Liam Broady said that he felt the ban was intended to “impact Jannik’s career as little as possible,” adding: “The ban ends the day before the Rome Masters, which is the biggest tournament in his home country and the perfect preparation for him to then go and play the French Open.

“I don’t think he loses any (ranking) points or his number one spot either, so it’s an interesting ban. I was speaking to some people earlier and they said it’s kind of like a Premier League footballer being banned over the summer (when they don’t play). It’s a difficult one.”

After his case first became public last year, Sinner revealed that his positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist. He said that his physiotherapist had been applying an over-the-counter spray to their own skin – not Sinner’s – to treat a small wound.

Initially avoiding suspension for the positive tests, Sinner was able to cement his position at the top of the world rankings and win grand slam titles at the 2024 US Open and this year’s Australian Open.

How tennis authorities handled the case, and also that of women’s world No. 2 Iga Świątek, has drawn criticism. Świątek accepted a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, though the ITIA said that they found her “level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence.’”

Two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep criticized the “big difference in treatment” she received – being handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in September 2023 after testing positive for banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open – compared to Świątek. Halep maintained that her anti-doping violations were not intentional and, in March last year, CAS agreed and reduced the backdated ban to nine months, clearing her to return to the sport.

In response to Halep’s accusation of double standards, the ITIA told CNN at the time that it “deal(s) with each case based on the facts and evidence, not a player’s name, ranking or nationality.”

Halep retired from the sport earlier this month, saying that it was “very hard” to reach the high level of play she expected from herself.

“I think right now, it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work for anti-doping,” 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic said on Monday.

“The inconsistency is something that frustrates all the players,” he added. “If you’re going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what’s happening, then there is no consistency, then there is no transparency … Right now, there is a lack of trust generally from tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and the ITIA and the whole process.”

Australian player Nick Kyrgios, meanwhile, said in a post on X that he received messages from “multiple players” about “how putrid this is” after Sinner’s three-month ban was announced.

An ITIA spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday: “Each case is different, but the ITIA approaches them in the same way, irrespective of a player’s ranking or status. We understand that anti-doping is a complex and sometimes confusing topic, and commit significant time and resources into providing education and support to players to help them understand the rules and how they apply to them.

“We actively encourage players and their support staff to speak with the ITIA about any issues, concerns, or queries they have about the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme.”

Sinner’s representatives declined to comment further when contacted by CNN.

“This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” Sinner said in a previous statement about the ban.

“I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.”

On Saturday, WADA said that it “accepts that Mr. Sinner did not intend to cheat, and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit.”

In a new statement to CNN on Tuesday, it said: “WADA is satisfied that justice has been delivered in this case and that the sanction is appropriate for the violation that was committed.

“WADA is pleased to have been able to deal with this matter in an open and transparent fashion with the facts of the case available and in the public domain for people to read. The fairness delivered in this unique case (in that the sanction fits the violation) shows that the system works very well.”"
Detroit Lions announce finalized 2025 coaching staff—here’s what’s new - Pride Of Detroit,The Detroit Lions have finalized their 2025 coaching staff. Here’s a closer look at the changes.,https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2025/2/18/24367879/detroit-lions-announce-finalized-2025-coaching-staff-heres-whats-new,sports,"The Detroit Lions announced on Tuesday the entirety of their 2025 coaching staff. Obviously, this year the Lions went through some pretty significant changes. Detroit lost both their offensive coordinator (Ben Johnson) and defensive coordinator (Aaron Glenn) to head coaching jobs, and both ended up taking a few Lions coaches with them.

So this year’s staff has a bunch of new names to it.

Here is the full list of the Lions’ coach staff, with new hires (or new positions for returning coaches) bolded.

Head Coach

Dan Campbell

Seth Ryan – Assistant Tight Ends

Hank Fraley – Run Game Coordinator/ Offensive Line

– Offensive Line Steve Oliver – Assistant Offensive Line

Bruce Gradkowski – Offensive Assistant

Marques Tuiasosopo – Offensive Assistant

Justin Mesa – Offensive Quality Control

The only unannounced changes here are the addition of two new assistants. Marques Tuiasosopo is a former NFL quarterback who has been coaching at the college level since 2009—most recently with Rice as their offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He also overlapped with new Lions offensive coordinator John Morton back during his playing days with the Raiders.

Justin Mesa, too has been coaching at the college level for about 15 years, serving roles from tight ends coach, wide receivers coach, and most recently as the Washington State special teams/assistant tight ends coach.

Also of note, Seth Ryan has moved from an assistant receivers coach to assistant tight ends.

Dre Thompson – WCF Minority Coaching Assistant/Defensive Quality Control

Jim O’Neil finally has “safeties” attached to his title, as that was the unit he worked with in an unofficial capacity in 2024.

Beyond that, there are two new assistants.

August Mangin has been with the 49ers since 2021. He served most recently as special teams quality control/game management specialist. Interestingly, he has a connection to new Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard, as they played alongside each other at LSU—Mangin as a fullback, Sheppard as a linebacker.

Caleb Collins also has an LSU background (defensive assistant—2018, 2019). He most recently was Baylor’s outside linebackers coach for the past four seasons.

Special teams staff

Before the latest addition of seven accusers, the Ravens potentially were hoping to wait until the start of the new league year in March before parting ways with Tucker. This approach would reduce the 2025 dead-money charge from $7.5175 million to $2.8725 million, pushing the remainder to 2026.

But nothing prevents the Ravens from announcing their intentions before that. The Jets did it last week with quarterback Aaron Rodgers, telling the world that they’ll be moving on. The official transaction will occur when the new league year begins and the 2025 cap charge falls from $49 million to $14 million.

Right or wrong, true or false, it’s difficult for the average, reasonable person to regard 16 total claims as embellished, baseless, or fabricated. And since the Ravens’ customer base consists of thousands of average, reasonable people, the P.R. ramifications of doing and saying nothing can’t be ignored.

Especially in light of coach John Harbaugh’s comments after the NFL suspended Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson for the same kind of behavior.

On one hand, the allegations haven’t been fully investigated. There’s a chance none will ever be proven in a court of law, especially since no lawsuits have been filed.

On the other hand, the total list of accusers has reached 16.

Even if the Ravens are being prudent, they’re on notice. The total number is too large to ignore, pending the conclusion of the league’s investigation.

And while silence keeps the news cycle from acquiring more oxygen, there’s a point at which silence becomes conspicuous. Eventually, the silence could be deafening."
Cubs Close To Signing Justin Turner - MLB Trade Rumors,The Chicago Cubs have reached an agreement with free agent Justin Turner.,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/02/cubs-close-to-signing-justin-turner.html,sports,"Feb. 19: Turner has reported to camp and is prepping for his first workout with the team, per Bruce Levine of 670 The Score. The Cubs still haven’t formally announced the signing, but his presence in camp surely means an announcement and corresponding 40-man move are imminent.

Unsurprisingly, he’ll work primarily as a first baseman and as a designated hitter, per Patrick Mooney of The Athletic. Turner only has 90 innings at third base over the past two seasons, so logging any kind of regular action there was never likely. He could get an occasional spot start, but the likelier role will be to spell Busch once or twice per week, spell Suzuki on occasion, and step in as DH when Suzuki is filling in at the outfield corners.

Feb. 18: The Cubs are reportedly in agreement with 40-year-old free agent Justin Turner on a one-year, $6MM deal. The signing, which is still pending a physical, includes another $2.5MM in performance bonuses for the Vayner Sports client. Chicago will need to make a 40-man roster move once the deal is finalized.

Despite his age, Turner remained a productive bat for the Blue Jays and Mariners in 2024. He hit 24 doubles and 11 home runs while continuing to make the most of his plate discipline and contact skills en route to a .737 OPS and 117 wRC+. The righty batter was particularly productive for Seattle in September, slashing .295/.396/.449 with a 143 wRC+. In other words, there is little reason to doubt that he can still be a valuable contributor to a team with postseason aspirations.

Turner has qualified for the batting title in each of the past four seasons, but he will take on more of a part-time role with the Cubs. ESPN’s Jesse Rogers notes that Turner is expected to fill a backup role at first and third base. Chicago reportedly considered many options for such a job but ultimately settled on Turner after missing out on star third baseman Alex Bregman (per Rogers). The Cubs were a finalist to sign Bregman before he joined the Red Sox instead. The team also reportedly considered trading for Nolan Arenado, although it comes as no surprise that the Cardinals weren’t interested in trading Arenado to a division rival (per Mooney).

Primarily a third baseman in his younger days, Turner has only played a handful of games at the hot corner in each of the past two seasons. Instead, he has transitioned to a first base/DH role. However, both of those jobs are already spoken for in Chicago, with the promising sophomore Michael Busch at first base and Seiya Suzuki, arguably the team’s second-best hitter after Kyle Tucker, penciled in at DH.

So, Turner is likely to get his playing time as a backup option at multiple positions and a bat off the bench. He could also platoon with Busch at first if the lefty batter continues to struggle against same-handed pitching. On top of that, Turner will offer the club insurance in the case of an injury to Busch, Suzuki, or a corner outfielder; if Tucker or Ian Happ gets hurt, Suzuki could play the outfield with Turner taking over as the primary DH.

In addition, Turner will provide a bit more stability at third base, which is currently something of a question mark for the Cubs. Top prospect Matt Shaw seems to be the most likely choice to win the third base gig out of camp, but the 23-year-old has yet to play a game at the big league level. Thus, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer made it clear that Shaw is not yet guaranteed the starting job. However, the Cubs don’t exactly have a ton of other options. Jon Berti and Vidal Brujan both have MLB experience at third, but neither is a starting-caliber player at the position. Meanwhile, Rule 5 pick Gage Workman is himself an unknown quantity; he has not played a game above Double-A. The 40-year-old Turner isn’t necessarily a solution, but he will, at least, improve the team’s depth at third. His glove might be a liability, but if nothing else, he’s a talented hitter who knows how to play the position.

Patrick Mooney of The Athletic was first to report that the Cubs and Turner were finalizing a one-year, $6MM deal. Jon Heyman of The New York Post confirmed there was an agreement in place and reported the $2.5MM in performance bonuses."
College basketball rankings: No. 4 Duke cruises past Virginia as Cavaliers fall further into irrelevancy - CBS Sports,The Blue Devils inched closer toward the ACC regular-season title with a dominant victory on Monday,https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-no-4-duke-cruises-past-virginia-as-cavaliers-fall-further-into-irrelevancy/,sports,"It speaks to how far Virginia has fallen that Duke can win inside John Paul Jones Arena by 18 points on a Monday night and barely improve its resume. But unfortunately for the Cavaliers, not to mention the ACC, that's where we're at and why the school's next hire is crucial -- because it would be a shame to watch the program that won the 2019 NCAA Tournament slip further into irrelevancy than it already has; Virginia currently sits in 12th place of an ACC that might only get three teams into the 2025 NCAA Tournament.

That was impossible to imagine recently. Now, it's Virginia's reality.

Final score: Duke 80, Virginia 62.

I'll get to Duke in a second, but it's wild to think that the program that went 31-3 in 2018 and won the NCAA Tournament in 2019 is now 13-13 overall, 6-9 in the ACC and down to 100th at BartTorvik.com. That school deserves better, and the ACC needs it to be. Hopefully everything gets fixed soon.

As for Duke, the Blue Devils are now 23-3 overall, 15-1 in the ACC, ranked fourth in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings and headed toward the first conference championship of Jon Scheyer's coaching career. Despite starting three freshmen in an era when many believe that's not ideal, Duke has a two-game lead in the win column of the league standings and figures to be a favorite in every remaining game before Selection Sunday. In other words, barring too many upsets, the Blue Devils should be a No. 1 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament -- and thus set up to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 2019.

While the new league year technically doesn't begin until March 12, which is when signings and trades can become official, Tuesday marked the opening of the franchise tag window.

From now through 4 p.m. ET on March 4, all 32 teams are permitted to apply a franchise tag to one of their pending free agents. The one-year tender, which is fully guaranteed, is worth either the average of the top five salaries at the player's position, or 120% of the player's most recent salary (whichever is greater). Tagged players can still negotiate with other teams, but any offers they receive can be matched by the original team, and if the player departs, the acquiring team must surrender two first-round draft picks.

Transition tags can also be applied; these one-year offers allow the player to negotiate with other teams, but the original team receives no compensation if the player signs elsewhere.

Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse becomes 'Rocket Arena' in new rebranding - News 5 Cleveland WEWS,The Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Monsters have seen their home called a number of different names over the years.,https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/basketball/cavaliers/rocket-mortgage-fieldhouse-becomes-rocket-arena-in-new-rebranding,sports,"CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Monsters have seen their home called a number of different names over the years.

Gund Arena. Quicken Loans Arena. Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

And now, Rocket Arena.

Rock Entertainment Group announced the rebranding on Tuesday morning as part of the arena's 30th anniversary.

“Guided by Chairman Dan Gilbert’s vision, we are committed to making a positive impact on our communities, clients and fans. For 30 years, Rocket Arena has been a cornerstone of Cleveland, showcasing the energy and vibrancy of Northeast Ohio,” said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group, the Cavaliers, and Rocket Arena in a press release. “By hosting unforgettable sports and entertainment moments, we’ve united people across the region and beyond. As we enter this new chapter, we’re focused on elevating every aspect of the Rocket Arena experience and bringing Cleveland to the world.”

The venue that the Cavs and Monsters call home is also the host to many of Cleveland's large-scale events, concerts and shows.

It opened as Gund Arena in 1994 and has since hosted over 5,000 events, including five NBA Finals, two NBA All-Star Games, a record-setting 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.

When Dan Gilbert, Chairman of Rock Entertainment Group, acquired the Cavaliers in 2005, the arena was renamed Quicken Loans Arena.

In 2019, The Q, as some called it, was rebranded as Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse following a massive $185 million renovation:

Matt Brown reacts to Sean Strickland-Eric Nicksick fallout after UFC 312: ‘I don’t think you should criticize your fighter publicly’ - MMA Fighting,"Matt Brown reacts to the public criticism Eric Nicksick aired about Sean Strickland after his lackluster outing at UFC 312, which has effectively led to the coach and fighter splitting with Strickland later saying he doesn’t expect Nicksick to corner him agai…",https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/2/18/24367731/matt-brown-reacts-sean-strickland-eric-nicksick-dont-think-you-should-criticize-fighter-publicly,sports,"Sean Strickland’s lackluster outing at UFC 312, where he lost a lopsided decision to Dricus du Plessis, led to his head coach Eric Nicksick airing some grievances publicly in the days following the fight.

Breaking down the fight where Strickland just never really seemed to get going offensively, and things went from bad to worse after he suffered a broken nose in the fourth round, Nicksick called it a “very underwhelming performance” and that it was an “uninspiring effort” from his fighter. In return, Strickland released a video detailing a litany of physical issues he was dealing with leading up to UFC 312 while adding that he still considers Nicksick a friend but he is “probably not” returning to corner him again for future fights.

As a retired UFC fighter, and now full-time coach running his own gym, Matt Brown has lived through both sides of a situation like this and really the biggest problem comes down to how this was all handled publicly rather than behind closed doors.

“First and foremost, we have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes,” Brown said on the latest episode of The Fighter vs. The Writer. “There could be a million different things that we’re basing all this off a couple of paragraphs. Who knows.

“That’s all we can base it off of, [the way] it looks. It’s unfortunate. I don’t think you should criticize your fighter publicly.”

While Strickland certainly isn’t immune to criticism, Brown feels like it could have been handled better from a coach’s perspective by speaking out so publicly about what went wrong.

Brown believes there’s a level of trust maintained between a coach and fighter and breaking that — even if Nicksick was 100 percent correct with his analysis — can feel like a betrayal.

“A coach-athlete relationship is like boyfriend/girlfriend,” Brown explained. “You’ve got their back until you don’t when it’s all said and done. More like a marriage I guess. It’s to the death. You’ve got their back, and you’re there for them. You’re not fighting for them. All you’re doing is giving your belief on what you think they need to do. They’re trusting you with that belief.

“It doesn’t mean they’re going to do it, or they have to do it, or they’re bad if they don’t do it, or there’s something wrong if they don’t do it. You don’t know what they’re going through. You don’t know what it’s like standing in front of someone trying to kill you, especially guys that have never fought.”

Brown admits that he has a different reaction towards coaches who have never fought before offering an opinion, because that experience is a huge part of truly understanding what fighters go through.

“I try not to be overly critical,” Brown said. “I like guys like Eric Nicksick, but if you’ve never fought, you’re literally just giving an opinion. I think someone who’s fought, their opinion goes a lot farther. But it’s still an opinion. It’s like if you want to teach someone how to drive a car and you’ve never driven a car before. Do you really want to learn from that person? My 14-year-old son could tell you how to drive a car. He could teach someone how to drive a car, but do you want to learn from him? It doesn’t really make sense.

“I try not to be too much of a hater for guys who have never fought, because they can bring a lot of value to a camp, also. But if you’re going to sit there and act like your opinion is so good, and your belief of what they did was so good, I hope you’ve at least fought before so you can say ‘OK, I did that and I believe that you should.’”

When it comes to Strickland’s situation specifically, Brown sympathizes with why he might be upset that his coach criticized his performance so publicly after what was undoubtedly one of the worst nights of his life losing a UFC title fight.

From his own experience spending 15 years in the UFC, Brown obviously won and lost fights, but he always appreciated that his coaches had his back no matter what happened.

“That’s the whole thing with this entire conversation, we’re assuming a lot of things here, but if that is the case, I understand Strickland getting mad about it. 100 percent,” Brown said. “I’ve had terrible performances, and my coaches never said a word about it outside of to me. We talk about it.

“I’ve seen it a million times — well I haven’t lost a million fights — but you lose a fight and my coaches still had my back the next week or whatever. Somebody’s talking shit online, and they’re defending me. I personally, I appreciate that. It’s like when you sign up as a coach what your role is and what you’re doing.”

When it comes to coaches who have never fought before, Brown understands there’s a lot of knowledge and information that can be passed along but it’s still tough to truly know what’s happening in the cage if you’ve never experienced it.

“The thing is if you’ve never done it, I feel like you can only speak so much about it,” Brown said. “You might have a great opinion. Going back to the same analogy, my son could teach you how to drive. He could tell you to put your foot on the pedal, go easy on the brake, put it in drive, both hands on the wheel, but how does he know how to tell you to do when there’s a drunk driver next to you, and they’re swerving all over the road? Or you’re on ice? Or it’s a crazy rainstorm?

“It’s like when shit’s easy, it’s easy to say what to do. It’s when shit gets hard, and that’s why it blows my mind that there’s so many coaches out there that haven’t fought.”

Nicksick later responded to a clip of Brown’s comments in Instagram, writing, “I agree, Matt, looking back at it I made a mistake. My true intentions were to try and motivate him publicly, and that was a miscalculation on my part.”

Ranking 2024 NFL rookie classes after Year 1: NFC East places three teams at the top - CBS Sports,Let's take a look at every rookie class after Year 1,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-2024-nfl-rookie-classes-after-year-1-nfc-east-places-three-teams-at-the-top/,sports,"What does one do, how does one function when there's no NFL football being played? Easy. Reading rankings from the season to see where your team stacks up against the rest of the league. It's all we got right now.

Well, that is, until the NFL Scouting Combine, free agency, and the draft in late April.

Here, let's rank the rookie classes for all 32 teams.

The ""hits"" are ranked in order of how well they performed as rookies, and that ranking is based relative to when they were drafted. The higher the pick, the higher the expectation.

Year 1 hits: None

The first-year returns on the Browns' 2024 draft class were brutal. Second-round pick Michael Hall Jr. served a suspension for off-field conduct and provided a few minor glimmers of his pass-rush capability later in the season. That was essentially it. No one else contributed in a positive way.

Year 1 hits: None

The Lions' roster was stacked entering the 2024 season, so there wasn't much room for rookie-year playing time. At cornerback, that wasn't the case, however. First-rounder Terrion Arnold had his splashy moments yet also allowed a 100.4 quarterback rating in his coverage area. Can't consider him a Year 1 hit. The rest of the class hardly played, even in a season riddled with injuries in Detroit.

When is NFL combine 2025? Dates, times, schedule, TV channel, live stream, full list of prospects Josh Edwards

Year 1 hits: None

Dallas Turner's burst-and-bend combination was useful for defensive coordinator Brian Flores. Yet the rookie took a clear back seat to veterans as a young, first-round pick. Minnesota's kicker draft pick, Will Reichard, only hit on 80% of his field goals in Year 1.

Year 1 hits: None

Rough go of it in Year 1 for the Bengals' 2024 draft class, outside of offensive tackle Amarius Mims. Third-round wideout Jermaine Burton, perceived by many as a sleeper who'd thrive with Joe Burrow's downfield mastery, disappointed, as did second-round pick Kris Jenkins along the defensive line.

Year 1 hits: None

Offensive tackle Olu Fashanu provided moments of his immense promise in Year 1. He didn't dominate by any stretch of the imagination. Early in the year, Braelon Allen looked like a future touchdown machine then tapered off as the season progressed. Remember, though, Fashanu and Allen were two of the youngest prospects in the 2024 class. They're primed to progress in Year 2.

Year 1 hits: None

The Cowboys made progress -- albeit small progress -- from the past few draft classes with their 2024 collection of first-year pros. Left tackle Tyler Guyton held his own for most of the season despite some rough patches in pass protection. Linebacker Marist Liufau played with his hair on fire -- much like he did at Notre Dame -- countering misses with splashy plays near the line of scrimmage.

Year 1 hits: None

Xavier Legette wasn't completely unusable in Year 1, yet he hardly played up to first-round pick expectations. Tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders flashed. They weren't what I'd categorize as hits, and the Panthers didn't get other notable contributions from their rookie class.

Year 1 hits: None

Had Michael Penix Jr. started earlier in the season, I have a feeling he'd be widely considered a hit, although his wayward throws were at times drastically off target. The rest of the Falcons' 2024 class didn't amount to much at all.

Year 1 hit: LB Tyrice Knight

New head coach Mike Macdonald essentially got nothing from his initial rookie class in 2024 in the Pacific Northwest. First-round pick Byron Murphy gave the defense 21 pressures on 211 pass-rush snaps but didn't even manage to play 500 total snaps on the season. Tight end AJ Barner looked like a future TE No. 2 for short stretches. Clearly, the rookie who made the fastest transition to the NFL was fifth-round pick linebacker Tyrice Knight, who looks like a future three-down starter.

Year 1 hit: OT Taliese Fuaga

Rock-solid rookie season for Fuaga -- he logged over 1,000 snaps and surrendered fewer than 40 pressures -- along an offensive line protecting a litany of young quarterbacks after Derek Carr was lost for the season with injury. Cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry looked like a future reliable starter at boundary corner, and for a fifth-round rookie, Spencer Rattler didn't look ridiculously overwhelmed during his auditions.

Year 1 hit: WR Xavier Worthy

In one of the most glaring reminders that speed doesn't correlate directly to yards per reception, Worthy only averaged 10.8 yards per snag in Year 1 yet did catch 59 passes for more than 600 yards and had a productive performance in the playoffs.

Year 1 hits: EDGE Laiatu Latu, LB Jaylon Carlies

In terms of headlines or highlights, it was a quiet debut NFL campaign for Latu. He did finish with 38 pressures on 375 pass-rushing snaps. Carlies was the best value selection Indianapolis made, as the safety-turned-linebacker drafted in Round 1 had 36 tackles, two tackles for loss, and a pass breakup on just under 21% of the defensive snaps. The former Missouri star really flashed when healthy.

Year 1 hits: RB Ray Davis

The biggest Bills draft class in terms of number of selections did not feature an instant star, yet Buffalo got valuable contributions from a few first-year players, most namely Davis, who turned in a 100-yards-from-scrimmage performance in a road win against the Jets early in the season and carved a nice niche as the team's backup runner to James Cook.

Year 1 hits: CB Kamari Lassiter

Lassiter was the ideal cornerback across from All-Pro Derek Stingley Jr. He played in-your-face man coverage at a high level without many hiccups all season. The longtime Georgia star logged 10 pass breakups and three picks in the regular season.

Year 1 hit: QB Drake Maye

Beyond Maye, the Patriots' draft class was average at its very best. Yet the flashes from Maye are buoying this ranking. There's room to grow for this talented passer. When he was in rhythm as a rookie, he played like a future franchise quarterback.

Year 1 hit: QB Caleb Williams

Yes, I'm calling Williams a hit. Did he meet expectations? Absolutely not. But through all the hits and woeful offensive stretches for the Bears offense, Williams made a plethora of spectacular plays from the pocket and especially when getting creative with his legs. And 20 touchdowns to just six interceptions represents a fine rookie campaign from the classic stats perspective.

Year 1 hits: C Zach Frazier

Frazier was magnificent for an otherwise shoddy Steelers offensive line in 2024. The rookie anchored the interior of Pittsburgh's front and was equally as steady in pass protection as he was paving lanes for the ground game.

Year 1 hit: WR Marvin Harrison Jr.

Harrison Jr. didn't quite reach 1,000 yards receiving, and it was such a bizarre year for the Cardinals rookie. He entered the NFL with immense hype, which dissipated quickly. Yet 62 grabs for nearly 900 yards and eight scores will always be considered a strong first year in the NFL for a receiver.

Year 1 hits: CB Nate Wiggins, OT Roger Rosengarten

Wiggins integrated perfectly into Baltimore's defense. He played stingy man coverage and tackled well all year despite his spindly frame. He had an interception and 13 pass breakups to go along with 33 tackles in the regular season. While Rosengarten's rookie season won't ever be confused with Johnathan Odgen's, he played over 1,000 snaps, wasn't a weak link for the run blocking and only allowed 36 pressures in pass pro.

Year 1 hit: LB Edgerrin Cooper

Cooper might become one of the best linebackers in the league. Very soon. He was dynamite as a three-down defender for the Packers as a rookie. He anchors this Green Bay group.

Year 1 hit: EDGE Chop Robinson

Robinson surged as the season progressed, with 46 of his 56 pressures after Week 9. Running back Jaylen Wright demonstrated promise as a sizable yet explosive back too.

Year 1 hits: C JC Latham, NT T'Vondre Sweat

Neither Latham nor Sweat were outstanding. But two hits are better than one in these rankings, and Sweat gave us one of the highlights of the season with his interception return late in the year.

Year 1 hits: TE Brock Bowers, OL Jackson Powers-Johnson

Bowers rewrote the record books for rookie tight ends in 2024 and even after Davante Adams was traded, the added defensive attention didn't slow his production. JPJ played nearly 1,000 snaps at left guard, center, and right guard and looked like a future Pro Bowler most of his first season.

Green, the last pick in the second round, enjoyed one of the most underrated cornerback seasons in the NFC, with 61 tackles, a pick, and 13 pass breakups in San Francisco's defense. Puni has an argument as the sturdiest rookie blocker, and Mustapha asserted his will as a tackler often on the way to 72 takedowns in Year 1.

Alt and McConkey look like future franchise building blocks for the Chargers. I won't be surprised if All-Pro distinctions are on the horizon for those two. Still felt like an obscure fifth-round cornerback yet was far from that label with 10 pass breakups and four interceptions.

Year 1 hits: QB Bo Nix, WR Devaughn Vele

Nix played like he'd been operating Sean Payton's system for the last decade as a rookie. Smart, prudent decision-making -- for the most part -- and flashes of what made him an enormous recruit in the state of Alabama years ago. Vele gave the Broncos much more than your average seventh-round pick in ROI, with 41 catches for 475 yards and three scores in the regular season.

A shorter, fourth-round pick was the only running back in the 2024 class to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark, and he had 47 catches, quickly supplanting veteran Rachaad White as Tampa Bay's top ball carrier. Smith began the season as strongly as any rookie defensive back, and Barton was a reasonably steady force inside at center, although there's room for his game to improve in Year 2.

Year 1 hits: WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jarrian Jones CB

Thomas Jr. anchors the Jaguars' ranking here, as I genuinely believe he's the prototypical No. 1 receiver. Big, fast, sharp routes, vertical speed, ball-tracking brilliance, and YAC mastery. It was an amazing Year 1 for the former LSU standout. And he was the fourth receiver picked, at No. 23 overall. Jones did it all as a member of the Jaguars secondary as a rookie. He's a sizable slot who reliably tackled and routinely made plays on the football.

GM Les Snead knows what he's doing on draft weekend. Back-to-back magnificent classes, and in one fell swoop, he retooled the defensive line -- along with 2023 Defensive Rookie of the Year runner-up Kobie Turner, of course.

GM Howie Roseman hit three home runs with his first three swings at the plate in the 2024 draft. Mitchell played like a 10-year veteran in man coverage on the boundary, DeJean was tremendous as a do-everything slot corner/safety, and Hunt settled in as a disruptive pass-rushing specialist down the stretch and during the Eagles' Super Bowl run, donning Trent Cole's old No. 58.

GM Joe Schoen and Co. pieced together a fine 2024 class despite what ultimately was a disastrous season. Nabers might be the best receiver in the NFL someday (soon), and Phillips and Tracy were outstanding finds later in the draft. Tracy is a strong contender for second-best rookie back behind Irving in Tampa Bay.

Daniels concluding his rookie season as the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year pushes the Commanders over two of their NFC East rivals here. Sainristil was otherworldly at times -- particularly in the playoffs -- as a former slot cornerback playing on the perimeter, and Coleman held it down at left tackle as a rookie."
Red Sox Receive Excellent News On Potential Superstar Target - NESN,The Red Sox on Tuesday received significant news about a star player who could be a massive target for Boston next offseason.,https://nesn.com/2025/02/red-sox-receive-excellent-news-on-potential-superstar-target/,sports,"If the Red Sox want to bring Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to Boston, it appears the storied franchise will at least have an opportunity to state their case to the superstar slugger.

ESPN’s Jeff Passan on Tuesday morning reported Guerrero and the Blue Jays did not reach an agreement on a contract extension by the Monday night deadline the sides established. According to Passan, the four-time All-Star “does not plan to negotiate” a potential extension in-season, which sets the stage for Guerrero to hit free agency after the 2025 campaign.

This development could bode well for the Red Sox, for whom the 25-year-old reportedly “would love” to play if he ultimately leaves Toronto. Boston, meanwhile, reportedly is a big fan of Guerrero’s game, and one top MLB insider last month indicated Craig Breslow and company would have a “good shot” at landing the power-hitting first baseman if he hit the open market.

How good of a shot? Well, another MLB insider last month thought the Red Sox were dragging their feet on adding Alex Bregman because the organization intended to make an aggressive pursuit of Guerrero. Bregman ultimately landed in Boston, but the star infielder’s three-year pact with the club shouldn’t prevent it from going after Guerrero this winter.

No, there currently isn’t a tailor-made fit for Guerrero with the Red Sox. But when you consider the kind of damage he could do at Fenway Park, it’s a move Boston absolutely should explore when the time comes."
"Injury Updates on Tkachuk Bros, McAvoy and USA Stars Before NHL 4 Nations Championship - Bleacher Report",,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25155500-injury-updates-tkachuk-bros-mcavoy-and-usa-stars-nhl-4-nations-championship,sports,"Team USA expressed hope that some or all of the players who missed Monday's 4 Nations Face-Off game against Sweden will be able to play in Thursday's final against Canada in Boston.

Forwards Matthew Tkachuk and Auston Matthews, and defenseman Charlie McAvoy were all held out of Monday's game since the United States and Canada had already clinched their spots in the final.

Additionally, forward Brady Tkachuk suffered a lower-body injury when he slid into the net during the first period, and he did not play in the second or third period of Team USA's 2-1 loss.

McAvoy has already been ruled out for the 4 Nations Final, as the Boston Bruins announced Tuesday that he underwent tests at a local hospital related to an upper-body injury:

Vancouver Canucks defenseman Quinn Hughes is traveling to Boston to replace McAvoy, head coach Mike Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday.

According to ESPN's Greg Wyshynski, both Matthews and McAvoy were held out due to upper-body injuries, and while the exact nature of Matthew Tkachuk's injury was not revealed, he missed the third period of last weekend's win over Canada.

All of those absences were deemed ""precautionary"" by Team USA head coach Mike Sullivan, as was the decision to keep Brady Tkachuk off the ice during the second and third periods Monday. Sullivan added, ""We'll see how it responds, but I don't anticipate it being an issue,"" regarding Brady Tkachuk's availability for the final.

Sullivan also said Matthews was more ""nicked up"" than McAvoy, but Jim McBride of the Boston Globe reported that McAvoy was admitted into Massachusetts General Hospital on Monday for undisclosed reasons.

Per Wyshynski, Team USA star Jack Eichel expressed his belief that the Americans will be ""good to go"" for the final, and fellow Team USA forward Jack Hughes said, ""I mean, I'm not a doctor. But I'm sure a lot of those guys will be playing on Thursday.""

With Matthew Tkachuk, Matthews and McAvoy missing Monday's game, Team USA inserted forward Chris Kreider and defenseman Jake Sanderson into the lineup. The Americans played one player short, and they were actually two players down for most of the game once Brady Tkachuk went out.

The Team USA roster can cover the absence of one forward and one defenseman, but if more than that cannot play in the final, the United States brought Hughes into the picture.

Canada had to do that with defenseman Thomas Harley in the first game against Team USA when both Shea Theodore and Cale Makar were unavailable.

Sullivan had acknowledged that Team USA would make alternative plans if need be, but added, ""We're hopeful we're going to get some of these guys back. I would anticipate we would."""

"Ranking the top 10 first basemen in MLB: Is Freeman, Harper or Vlad Jr. No. 1? - ESPN",Buster Olney's dive into the best players at every position entering 2025 continues with a power-packed infield spot.,https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/43889852/mlb-buster-olney-top-10-position-players-ranking-first-basemen-freeman-guerrero-harper,sports,"Open Extended Reactions

Spring training camps are underway, which means it is time to look at the state of baseball. As part of our 2025 MLB season preview, ESPN's Buster Olney is bringing back his positional ranking series, in which he surveyed those around the industry to help him rank the top 10 players at every position.

Today, we rank the best of the best at first base.

The objective of this exercise is to identify the best players for the 2025 season, not who might be best in five years or over their career. We will roll out a position per day over the next two weeks. Here's the rest of the schedule: catchers (2/17), second basemen (2/19), third basemen (2/20), shortstops (2/21), corner outfielders (2/24), center fielders (2/25), designated hitters (2/26), starting pitchers (2/27) and relievers (2/28).

When you peruse the names of just about all of the first basemen in the top 10 on this list, you might notice a common denominator beyond the position they play. Freddie Freeman is one of the best left-handed hitters of his generation, but he throws right-handed. Bryce Harper bats left but throws right. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. throws right-handed and so does Pete Alonso.

In fact, only one of the top 10 first basemen is a left-handed thrower, which is strange because of the natural advantages a left-handed thrower has at the position -- quicker tags on pickoffs and better angles on throws to other bases. Any list of the most aesthetically pleasing aspects of the sport would have to include the defensive work of the best and smoothest first basemen in history, from Keith Hernandez and Don Mattingly to J.T. Snow and Anthony Rizzo.

And yet the number of left-handed throwing first basemen has dropped significantly since 2000, as the numbers dug out by Sarah Langs show:

2001: 1,905 (games played by left-handed throwing 1B)

2006: 1,589

2011: 1,836

2016: 1,356

2021: 944

2024: 1,173

A platoon of evaluators -- from major league coaches to managers to general managers to those in player development, to Don Mattingly, who was one of the best left-handed throwing first basemen ever -- were asked about this trend and offered little beyond surprise. ""I have no idea,"" one front-office type said. ""It's not tied to any larger strategy.""

Another texted, ""I can't think of a reason. Maybe it's just random?""

One staffer noted that many first basemen are converted from other positions, often in the infield. Harper is an example of this: He was a catcher as an amateur, was shifted to the outfield by the Nationals, then moved to first base after having elbow surgery.

Matt Olson throws right-handed. Paul Goldschmidt throws right-handed. Both reigning Gold Glove winners, Christian Walker and Carlos Santana, throw right-handed.

Go figure.

Now here are the Top 10 first basemen, based on feedback from evaluators:"
CFP Insider - What sources are saying about playoff change - ESPN,"Playoff expansion, seeding, play-in games among the topics this week when the Big Ten and SEC meet.",https://www.espn.com/college-football/insider/story/_/id/43890780/college-football-playoff-sources-saying-cfp-change,sports,"Open Extended Reactions

For the second time in four months, conference leaders from the SEC and Big Ten will meet in person to discuss common ground during a critical decision-making period in college athletics. Wednesday's meeting in New Orleans will include discussions about the House vs. NCAA settlement and future NCAA governance, but it will also include important conversations about the College Football Playoff and what the two most powerful conferences want it to look like moving forward.

In less than a week, the CFP's management committee will meet in Dallas to begin a thorough review of the inaugural 12-team field. Athletic directors in the Big Ten and SEC will first have a chance, though, to express their preferences to their respective commissioners before the Big Ten's Tony Petitti and SEC's Greg Sankey meet with their FBS peers.

""I would imagine that coming out of that Big Ten-SEC meeting that they will come to the table with proposed governance, proposed format -- all of that,"" one CFP source said. ""I think that's everybody's expectation, but I don't expect anything radical that hasn't already been discussed.""

While there is no guarantee that any firm decisions will be made, ESPN spoke to multiple sources that included athletic directors, commissioners and CFP sources about what they might learn this week.

VAR audio released of decision to award Barcelona penalty against Rayo for foul on Inigo Martinez released - Barca Blaugranes,Here’s what the officials made of it all....,https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2025/2/18/24367756/var-audio-decision-award-barcelona-penalty-rayo-foul-inigo-martinez-released,sports,"Barcelona beat Rayo Vallecano 1-0 on Monday thanks to a penalty from Robert Lewandowski after a foul on Inigo Martinez.

Predictably, there was plenty of debate at the time about whether it was the correct decision as the incident was missed initially but given after a VAR check.

The discussion between the match officials has now been released which explains why Barcelona were awarded a penalty.

“Mario, I recommend an OFR [on-field review] so that you can evaluate a possible penalty,” said VAR referee Díaz de Mera.

“Perfect, I’ll see it. Show me the image so I can see the grab. It was Pathé Ciss, wasn’t it?” replied match referee Mario Melero López.

“Yes,” was the response from VAR.

“Ok, he’s ignoring the ball. He’s clearly ignoring it. The ball is not in the area but it’s clear. With his left hand he’s holding him by the stomach. He’s not looking at the ball and he’s completely forgetting about the ball. I’m going to signal a penalty and a yellow card,” was the verdict from the ref.

“Perfect Mario.”

Barcelona were then awarded a penalty which Lewandowski slotted home for his 20th La Liga goal of the season."
"Doctor details options for Yankees’ Giancarlo Stanton, who’s been in pain for months - NJ.com","Dr. Spencer Stein, a sports orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone Health, details what Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton is dealing with and facing with tennis elbow in both arms.",https://www.nj.com/yankees/2025/02/yankees-giancarlo-stanton.html,sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — A NYU Langone Health sports orthopedic surgeon who treats patients with tennis elbow on a daily basis thinks the Yankees should be troubled that Giancarlo Stanton showed up for spring training in shutdown mode due to painful symptoms in both arms since early into the 2024 season.

“Usually it does get better, “Dr. Spencer Stein told NJ Advance Media by phone Monday. “The fact that it was hurting Giancarlo all last season and is flaring up again is a bit concerning.”

This issue probably could have been resolved in the offseason with surgery on both elbows after the World Series. If Stanton had opted for that instead of rest and rehab, which didn’t work, he’d likely have been completely healed before the start of spring training.

“There’s not a lot of studies on this in baseball, but it probably would be a couple months recovery,” Dr. Stein said. “Obviously, they’re trying to avoid surgery, which is essentially cleaning out the tendon and then possibly repairing as well.

“It’s a nagging thing that can be hard to get rid of, but usually it resolves. There are studies where 95 percent of the time it does resolve, but we do operate on patients that don’t get better.”

The doctor wasn’t surprised hearing Stanton is dealing with this issue because the slugger has been taking vicious swings for many years. His average swing last year was clocked at 82 mph, highest in the majors.

“It makes sense because it’s a chronic, repetitive overuse injury, and that’s exactly what we’re dealing with,” Dr. Stein said. “It’s inflammation and can lead to a bit of degeneration of tendons on the outside of the elbow. These are tendons that help extend the wrist. It usually is worse with gripping or extending the wrist.”

“The inflammation is along a spectrum, and that can include tears.”

Stanton, who heavily relies on wrist action when he swings a bat, said during his Monday interview, “Look, tennis elbow or whatever they call it is tears in your tendon.”

Lateral epicondylitis is the medical term for tennis elbow.

“There are a couple other things that could be,” Dr. Stein said, “but it’s much more rare, like a nerve compression.

“I’m sure the Yankees’ doctors are checking everything. Usually it ends up being tennis elbow, which is very, very common in the general population. One person probably comes to me with that every day in a normal workday.”

Dr. Stein doesn’t often have patients with tennis elbow in both arms, though.

“It’s interesting,” he said. “It comes from the backhand in tennis, so for Giancarlo, a right-handed hitter, typically it would be the backhand, the left elbow. But it can happen in both and some people tend to be more prone to it for whatever reason.

“It’s usually worse with gripping. So batting, I guess it makes sense with that.”

The suffering was intense for Stanton through most of last season, but he opted to play through it.

“It’s a nagging, gnawing sharp pain,” Dr. Stein said. “It radiates down the forearm. It’s debilitating. It’s hard to grip. You lose strength. It’s hard to exercise.”

Surgery usually is a last resort because other methods usually work.

“Typically it is treated without surgery,” Dr. Stein said. “There are treatment options like shutting it down, therapy, PRP injections. There’s shockwave where essentially sound waves are delivered to the area to help stimulate regeneration or healing of the tendon. There are nitroglycerin patches for blood flow in the area. There are tennis elbow braces.

“Another thing people do is steroid injections for these, but we really now are limiting the amount of steroids we give because it can make the issue worse. That’s an easy fix, but I would not recommend that for a pro baseball player.”

Because the issue didn’t go away during the offseason, Dr. Stein thinks surgery might be the best option because it likely would fix this for good. If Stanton was his patient, dhe doctor says he’d probably fix both elbows in one procedure.

“Without having exams, it’s hard to tell if one side is worse than the other,” Dr. Stein said. “If one side is worse, maybe I’d go for one side at a time. But it probably makes sense to do them both together because then you shorten the overall return to play.”

Stanton isn’t sure if he’ll be able to avoid being on the injured list for Opening Day, which is March 27 at Yankee Stadium, but he figures he’ll deal with the pain this season like he did last year.

Stanton had a pretty solid regular season, batting .233 with 27 homers and 72 RBI in 114 games. In October he was a postseason star with seven homers and 16 RBI during a 14-game run that ended with the Dodgers winning the World Series in five.

Most of this was accomplished with Stanton playing in pain.

“Amazing,” Dr. Stein said. “Giancarlo had a wonderful postseason run that was truly crucial. He was shining for the whole team.”

Banks combines top-tier foot speed with a powerful, well-balanced frame. His flexibility and wide base allow him to maintain leverage, while his ability to move in a low stance makes him highly effective in both pass protection and the run game.

Williams has an ideal frame for an edge rusher, combining pro-level size, length, and power. His explosive first step and violent arm-over move make him a disruptive force inside, while his high motor ensures he plays to the whistle. A strong and reliable run defender, he brings a well-rounded skill set that should translate well to the next level.

Zabel is an outstanding athlete for an offensive lineman, combining explosiveness, flexibility, and elite grip strength. His ability to line up defenders squarely, both at the line and on the move, makes him a strong fit for a zone-blocking scheme. With consistent leg drive, excellent core strength, and the ability to sink his hips despite his 6-foot-6 frame, he has the tools to be a high-level offensive lineman at the next level.

Williams brings a compact, powerful frame that allows him to play both nose tackle and 3-tech. His explosive first step helps him shoot gaps and generate power, while his improved hand speed and technique in 2024 make him an even more disruptive interior presence.

Pearce is a twitchy, explosive pass rusher with a lightning-quick first step and fast, active hands. Despite his lighter frame, he flashes an effective speed-to-power punch and has the movement skills to develop in coverage if needed. His natural anticipation and ability to time the snap make him a disruptive force off the edge.

Campbell plays with balance, control, and efficiency, using quick, compact movements to stay in position. His active hands are always ready to strike, and his patience allows him to react rather than overcommit. While his base is narrower, he has adequate power to hold his own at the next level.

A well-built and powerful defender, Nolen’s raw strength and explosiveness make him a force at the line of scrimmage. He can play both defensive end and tackle, using his momentum to overwhelm blockers.

A rare athlete for the position, he combines elite explosiveness and bend with a natural feel for pass rushing. Despite his lighter frame, he plays with physicality and uses his basketball background to his advantage, displaying a crossover-like style to keep blockers off balance.

Jeanty is a total-package backfield playmaker with impressive balance, footwork, vision, explosiveness and big-play ability — reminiscent of Alvin Kamara. He is a first-round offensive weapon who can succeed behind any blocking scheme.

Loveland lacks the density to play as an inline tight end consistently in the NFL, but he brings plenty of value as a tall, long pass catcher with natural hands and crisp routes to line up as a big slot or “X” receiver. He also has some versatility to play attached to the line of scrimmage in certain situations.

Scourton loves to hit his offensive tackles with a spin move, something not many have mastered as well as the true junior. He also has effective reps with cross-chop, push-pull and rip variations. At 6-foot-4 and 280 pounds, Scourton's pass-rush approach at his size makes him tough to stay in front of.

Barron brings versatility and physicality to the secondary, with the ability to play anywhere in the defensive backfield. He has the strength to shed blocks and make tackles in run support, along with the closing speed to disrupt plays in coverage.

Grant is a rare blend of size and athleticism, displaying exceptional quickness for a player of his stature. He reacts quickly to counters, keeps his hands active in passing lanes, and has the movement skills to be a disruptive interior force.

Warren is a do-everything tight end whom any coach would love to input into their offense. He isn't a twitchy or flexible athlete who can unlock the whole route tree, but his versatility is incredibly valuable in the run and pass games — and worthy of a first-round selection.

An explosive interior defender with an elite first step, Graham combines excellent bend and flexibility with fast, powerful hands. His devastating push-pull move makes him a nightmare for blockers, while his strength allows him to anchor and hold the line effectively.

Conerly has extensive experience on the left side over the past two seasons at Oregon, where he allowed just a 0.6% knockdown rate across 1,000-plus pass-blocking snaps.

McMillan has All-Pro potential because of his length, athleticism and football intelligence. He's a smooth criminal of a receiver who was the focal point of Arizona's offense. He is a unique talent who deserves to be considered in the top 10 of the 2025 NFL Draft.

Loveland lacks the density to play as an inline tight end consistently in the NFL, but he brings plenty of value as a tall, long pass catcher with natural hands and crisp routes to line up as a big slot or “X” receiver. He also has some versatility to play attached to the line of scrimmage in certain situations.

Membou combines balance, power, and mobility, thanks to his impressive hip and hamstring flexibility. His quick feet allow him to mirror defenders, while his effectiveness as a puller and lead blocker adds to his versatility. With solid arm length for the pro level, he has the tools to be a dependable tackle at the next stage.

A well-built safety with good athleticism, Starks boasts impressive top-end speed and a long wingspan that helps him disrupt passing lanes. His smooth, fluid hips give him excellent range in deep coverage, while his strong communication skills make him a leader on the back end.

Grant is a rare blend of size and athleticism, displaying exceptional quickness for a player of his stature. He reacts quickly to counters, keeps his hands active in passing lanes, and has the movement skills to be a disruptive interior force.

A rare athlete for the position, he combines elite explosiveness and bend with a natural feel for pass rushing. Despite his lighter frame, he plays with physicality and uses his basketball background to his advantage, displaying a crossover-like style to keep blockers off balance.

Burden is an ideal “five-tool,” multi-sport athlete for the receiver position in the NFL. The first-round talent is as well-rounded as they come, with the ability to succeed at any receiver spot in any offense.

Sanders may be below average in stature and arm talent compared to NFL quarterbacks, but he plays the game cleanly, takes care of the football and is tough as nails with ice in his veins under pressure.

Johnson moves like a much smaller corner despite being over 6 feet and 200 pounds. His versatility allows him to play on either side, shadow top receivers and even line up in the slot when needed. With a strong grasp of leverage, smooth transitions in coverage and a disciplined approach to run fits, he projects as a high-level, scheme-versatile corner at the next level.

The Eagles aren’t hesitant to invest in smaller edge rushers — Ezeiruaku measured in at 6-foot, 248 pounds at the Senior Bowl — and his pass-rush production in 2024 was worthy of a top-10 pick. He ended his college career on an incredible tear, tallying eight sacks, 10 quarterback hits, and 29 total pressures over his final four games at Boston College.

Golden is a talented player whose movement skills should translate well to the NFL. His advanced avenues of success — whether through beating press, impressive footwork, after-the-catch ability or kick-return prowess — make him a player who could be a high-end WR2 in the league.

Campbell plays with balance, control, and efficiency, using quick, compact movements to stay in position. His active hands are always ready to strike, and his patience allows him to react rather than overcommit. While his base is narrower, he has adequate power to hold his own at the next level.

Williams has an ideal frame for an edge rusher, combining pro-level size, length, and power. His explosive first step and violent arm-over move make him a disruptive force inside, while his high motor ensures he plays to the whistle. A strong and reliable run defender, he brings a well-rounded skill set that should translate well to the next level.

Morrison’s length, instincts, and technical refinement make him a standout cornerback prospect. His long arms and active hands allow him to excel in press coverage, while his quick transitions and ball-tracking skills help him stay in phase downfield. A high-IQ player with strong awareness and a willingness to contribute in run defense, he brings a well-rounded skill set to the next level.

Appreciating Ward — an unorthodox, big-game quarterback — requires a leap of faith. He is ultra-confident, at times to a fault. His mentality could one day make him an All-Pro — that is, if his fundamentals don't drop him from the league entirely.

"Cam Ward: If you don’t draft me that’s your fault, and I’ll remember that - NBC Sports",Miami quarterback Cameron Ward is the betting favorite to be the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft.,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/cam-ward-if-you-dont-draft-me-thats-your-fault-and-ill-remember-that,sports,"Miami quarterback Cameron Ward is the betting favorite to be the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft. But if he doesn’t go first overall, he’s planning to make any team that passes on him regret it.

Ward said he’s looking forward to talking to NFL teams at the Combine, and delivering a message about what kind of competitor he is.

“OK, you’re either going to draft me or you’re not,” Ward said, via the Associated Press. “If you don’t draft me, that’s your fault. You’ve got to remember you’re the same team that’s got to play me for the rest of my career, and I’ll remember that.”

Ward said he’d like to emulate the rookie season Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels just had.

“To see him succeed,” Ward said of Daniels, “is motivating for not only myself but all of the other quarterbacks.”

Ward hopes he can convince NFL teams that he can have the immediate impact that Daniels had."
"Report: Bengals aim for long-term deals with Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, Trey Hendrickson - NBC Sports",The Bengals have apparently gotten the message that Joe Burrow was sending.,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/report-bengals-aim-for-long-term-deals-with-jamarr-chase-tee-higgins-trey-hendrickson,sports,"The Bengals have heard Joe Burrow’s message. Loud and clear.

Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com reports that the Bengals will attempt to sign three key players to long-term deals: receiver Ja’Marr Chase, receiver Tee Higgins, and defensive end Trey Hendrickson.

Trying and doing are two different things, of course. Last year, they tried to sign Chase. And while the dollars made sense, the structure did not.

So the real question is whether the last, best offers made by the team to any, some, or all of them will be good enough.

For Chase, it’s likely going to take at least $40 million per year in new-money average. With a structure that includes sufficient guarantees and cash flow. It won’t be easy. It would have been easier last year, before Chase led the league in catches, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns during the 2024 season.

For Higgins, on whom the Bengals reportedly “likely” usethe tag absent a multi-year contract, the starting point for any negotiation will be the value of his tag. He can play under the tag, make $26.8 million, and hit the market next March. The Bengals will have to offer him a multi-year deal that will cause him to trade in the tag.

If, for example, the contract offer contains no full guarantees (or practical guarantees) beyond year one, why would he take it? The first-year payout would have to be a lot more than $26.8 million to get him to take a deal that carries only one year of true guarantees.

For Hendrickson, his $16 million compensation package is currently less than half of the market-leading price for his position. They’ll need to get a lot closer to Nick Bosa’s $34 million annual new-money average for the guy who had 17.5 sacks in each of the last two seasons.

Until the deals are done, the team’s goal might be simply to make Burrow think they’re trying. Because if he thinks they aren’t, he potentially inches closer to the Carson Palmer DEFCON 1."
Early Life Stress Rewires Brain Circuits Linked to Social Motivation - Neuroscience News,"New research shows that early life stress disrupts dopamine signaling, altering social motivation and behavior.",https://neurosciencenews.com/early-stress-social-motivation-28428/,health,"Summary: New research shows that early life stress disrupts dopamine signaling, altering social motivation and behavior. Scientists found that mice raised in stressful conditions were less likely to engage in social interactions compared to those with enriched experiences.

The study identifies a weakened neural pathway between the ventral tegmental area and the basolateral amygdala as a key factor. Using advanced techniques to activate or silence dopamine neurons, researchers could artificially restore or suppress social motivation in mice.

This suggests that social avoidance behaviors may stem from disrupted neural circuits rather than inherent personality traits. The findings could inform new treatments for individuals with social difficulties linked to early life trauma.

Key Facts:

Dopamine and Social Behavior: Early life stress reduces dopamine neuron connections between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala, impairing social motivation.

Early life stress reduces dopamine neuron connections between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala, impairing social motivation. Experimental Control of Behavior: Activating dopamine neurons restored social behavior in stressed mice, while silencing them caused socially engaged mice to become avoidant.

Implications for Human Health: Understanding these neural circuits may help develop interventions for social difficulties linked to childhood neglect or trauma.

Neuroscientists have new insights into why previous experiences influence future behaviors.

Experiments in mice reveal that personal history, especially stressful events, influences how the brain processes whether something is positive or negative. These calculations ultimately impact how motivated a rodent is to seek social interaction or other kinds of rewards.

To test this hypothesis, Stone and his colleagues leveraged cutting-edge laboratory techniques that allowed them to artificially activate or silence dopamine inputs into the basolateral amygdala from the ventral tegmental area. Credit: Neuroscience News

In a first of its kind study, Tufts University School of Medicine researchers demonstrate that interfering with the neural circuits responsible for emotional decisions can increase or decrease socially avoidant behaviors in mice, regardless of whether they had enriched or adverse experiences as pups.

The findings, appearing February 13 in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that antisocial behaviors associated with childhood neglect or related forms of abuse may result from dysfunctional dopamine signaling in the midbrain.

Many aspects of motivation involve dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for pleasurable feelings. When a mammal does something that enhances the chances of survival, such as eat a tasty meal or engage in sex, dopamine levels surge.

In humans (and mice), positive social interactions are generally rewarded by a burst of activity in the ventral tegmental area—a pathway of dopamine-releasing neurons. It connects the basolateral amygdala, a clump of nerves in the midbrain where emotions are processed, to the prefrontal cortex, where the brain makes critical decisions surrounding emotion and motivation.

“If people with early life stress are losing the ability to send information from parts of the brain that are needed for motivated behaviors, it made sense that we’d see less crosstalk between these two areas,” says first author Bradly Stone, who conducted the research as a Tufts postdoctoral scholar.

“The result that turned our heads was that early life stress reduces the number of dopaminergic neurons between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala, suggesting that network architecture is impaired.”

To test this hypothesis, Stone and his colleagues leveraged cutting-edge laboratory techniques that allowed them to artificially activate or silence dopamine inputs into the basolateral amygdala from the ventral tegmental area.

They applied this to a classic behavioral protocol in which a mouse is given the choice to investigate chambers with either a toy or a stranger mouse. Mice with carefree early days visited the stranger mouse as expected.

However, mice that experienced maternal neglect primarily opted to do nothing or interact with the toy. This was only revealed when the investigators activated the dopaminergic neurons between the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala.

Importantly, when dopaminergic neurons were turned off in animals with carefree early days, they started behaving like animals who grew up with maternal neglect.

“This experiment was a beautiful part to this story that really made me believe in the work,” says Stone.

“It’s evidence that social avoidance is governed by a delicate balance of interconnected neural elements and early life stress shapes these connections in a nuanced way that impairs their ability to function.”

“Early Life Stress Impairs VTA Coordination of BLA Network and Behavioral States” by Bradly Stone et al. Journal of Neuroscience

Abstract

Early Life Stress Impairs VTA Coordination of BLA Network and Behavioral States

Motivated behaviors, such as social interactions, are governed by the interplay between mesocorticolimbic structures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

Adverse childhood experiences and early life stress (ELS) can impact these networks and behaviors, which is associated with increased risk for psychiatric illnesses.

While it is known that the VTA projects to both the BLA and mPFC, the influence of these inputs on local network activity which govern behavioral states – and whether ELS impacts VTA-mediated network communication – remains unknown.

Our study demonstrates that VTA inputs influence BLA oscillations and entrainment of mPFC activity in mice, and that ELS weakens the ability of the VTA to coordinate BLA network states, while also impairing dopaminergic signaling between VTA and BLA.

Optogenetic stimulation of VTA BLA terminals decreased social interaction in ELS mice, which can be recapitulated in control mice by inhibiting VTA-BLA communication.

These data suggest that ELS impacts social reward via the VTA-BLA dopamine network."
How the Body’s Clock Influences Eating and Weight Gain in Teens - Neuroscience News,"A new study reveals that the body’s internal clock plays a key role in eating behavior, influencing when and how much adolescents eat.",https://neurosciencenews.com/circadian-rhythm-teen-eating-28427/,health,"Summary: A new study reveals that the body’s internal clock plays a key role in eating behavior, influencing when and how much adolescents eat. Researchers found that teens with overweight or obesity consumed significantly more calories later in the day compared to those with a healthy weight.

By isolating circadian influences from environmental and behavioral factors, they confirmed that food intake peaks in the late afternoon and evening regardless of sleep duration or external time cues. The findings highlight the biological basis of eating patterns and suggest that modifying light exposure and meal timing could help manage weight.

Key Facts:

The causes of obesity are complex and influenced by many factors. While research has highlighted connections between sleep, eating patterns and weight gain, scientists remain uncertain of the role of the circadian system — the biological clock — in shaping eating patterns.

But a new study from researchers at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Mass General Brigham reveals a distinct relationship between circadian rhythms, weight and eating habits in adolescents, a vulnerable age group whose eating patterns influence their lifelong health.

The study found that adolescents whose weight was classified as “overweight” or “obese” consumed more calories later in the day compared to participants with healthy weights.

The results demonstrate that circadian rhythms play an important role in explaining later caloric intake in individuals at risk for obesity, said lead investigator Mary Carskadon, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown’s medical school.

“The critical nature of adolescent development to set the stage for a lifetime of health highlights the need to understand the roles played by sleep/wake and circadian timing processes for eating behavior,” said Carskadon, who also directs the Bradley Hospital Sleep Research Laboratory.

“The knowledge gained here opens a door to potential interventions that can enhance teen health moving forward.”

The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Isolating circadian influences

The circadian system is composed of trillions of “clocks” present in virtually all organs, tissues and cells, which prepares biology and behavior to adapt to the changing demands across the day/night cycle.

The influence of the circadian system is known to differ between people due to a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors.

Previous studies have analyzed sleeping and eating behavior using measures of self-reported hunger and other variables, said study author David Barker, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior (research) at Brown.

Some factors that set this study apart, Barker said, were the meticulous measuring of food before and after meals and the fact that environmental and behavioral influences were controlled for while the participants remained in the lab.

Fifty-one volunteers between the ages of 12 and 18 participated in the study, which was conducted at the Bradley Hospital Sleep Research Laboratory. Participants were divided into three groups based on body mass index.

They were placed on 28-hour sleep and wake cycles — slightly longer than a typical 24-hour day — and stayed in a controlled dim-light setting while awake and in complete darkness during sleep.

Participants remained in the same space throughout the study, which lasted for 11 days and 10 nights. To control for outside influences on circadian rhythm, researchers removed all external time cues from the lab’s environment, including clocks and access to natural light.

Participants received six opportunities to eat at fixed times across the wake episode, with a standardized menu and could consume as much food during the meal as they wanted.

Researchers tracked the food that was eaten as well as caloric intake. During the day, they were monitored by student research apprentices from Brown University and other institutions, who offered opportunities to join in a variety of activities including making crafts, watching movies (with screen lights dimmed) and playing social games.

The results showed that changes in the circadian system throughout the day and night significantly influenced food consumption. In all three groups, food intake peaked in the late afternoon and early evening and was lowest in the morning, even after accounting for behavioral and environmental factors, demonstrating that the body’s biological clock directly impacts how much people eat at different times of the day.

Adolescents in the obesity and overweight groups consumed significantly more calories in the circadian evening compared to those in the healthy weight group. Researchers found no significant differences in total sleep time between or within the groups across sleep cycles.

According to study author Frank Scheer, director of the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, it was already well known that the circadian system affects hunger and metabolism.

What remained unclear, he said, was whether the circadian system — when isolated from influences of environmental and behavioral cycles, including light, sleep and activity cycles — directly influences food consumption.

“This study is the first to demonstrate that food intake itself is regulated by our internal body clock,” Scheer said.

Body clocks, food intake and weight

Future studies are needed to determine whether affecting circadian control of food intake contributes to weight changes, if weight changes impact the circadian control of food intake, or a combination of the two.

Carskadon said that the findings like those from the study could inform clinicians counseling adolescents on ways to manage their weight.

“For example, the influence of circadian timing could be influenced by excluding light late in the day and enhancing bright light in the morning, especially while exercising,” Carskadon said.

“That might help pull the rhythms to a better place — and also create healthy habits.”

With future research, the team aims to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between the circadian system, diet and metabolism, as well as the mechanisms underlying these relationships, and the implications for developing timed dietary interventions to improve health.

Scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have developed a lipid nanoparticle system capable of delivering messenger RNA (mRNA) to the brain via intravenous injection, a challenge that has long been limited by the protective nature of the blood-brain barrier.

The findings, in mouse models and isolated human brain tissue, were published in the February 17 online issue of Nature Materials.

They demonstrate the potential of this technology to pave the way for future treatments for a wide range of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain cancer, and drug addiction.

The blood-brain barrier serves as a protective shield, preventing many substances—including potentially beneficial therapies—from reaching the brain. While previous research from Mount Sinai introduced a platform for transporting large biomolecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides into the central nervous system, this new study focuses on a different approach: using specially designed lipid nanoparticles to transport mRNA across the barrier.

Getting mRNA into the brain could allow scientists to instruct brain cells to produce therapeutic proteins that can help treat or prevent disease by replacing missing proteins, reducing harmful ones, or activating the body’s defenses.

“Our study shows that these blood-brain barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) can safely and efficiently deliver mRNA into the brain,” says co-corresponding senior author Yizhou Dong, PhD, Professor of Immunology and Immunotherapy, and a member of the Icahn Genomics Institute and the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

“This could open up opportunities to use mRNA-based therapies for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.”

The research team designed and tested a library of lipids to optimize their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Through a series of structural and functional analyses, they identified a lead formulation, termed MK16 BLNP, that exhibited significantly higher mRNA delivery efficiency than existing lipid nanoparticles approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This system takes advantage of natural transport mechanisms within the blood-brain barrier, including caveolae- and γ-secretase-mediated transcytosis, to move nanoparticles across the barrier, say the investigators.

In studies using mouse models of disease, the BLNP platform successfully delivered therapeutic mRNAs to the brain, demonstrating its potential for clinical application.

“Our lipid nanoparticle system represents an important step in the effort to develop mRNA-based treatments for central nervous system disorders,” says Dr. Dong.

“The study provides proof of concept that such an approach is viable and could be adapted for a range of diseases where gene therapy or mRNA therapeutics might play a role.”

The researchers note that additional studies are needed to assess long-term safety and efficacy, including toxicology studies in accordance with FDA guidelines. Future research will focus on refining the technology for clinical translation.

“Our findings highlight the potential of lipid nanoparticles in overcoming one of the major challenges in treating brain diseases,” says co-corresponding senior author Eric J. Nestler, MD, PhD, Director of The Friedman Brain Institute, Dean for Academic Affairs, and Nash Family Professor in the Nash Family Department of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Chief Scientific Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System.

“We are very excited to continue evaluating this novel platform for broader therapeutic applications.”

“Blood–brain-barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery to the central nervous system” by Yizhou Dong et al. Nature Materials

Abstract

Blood–brain-barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery to the central nervous system

The systemic delivery of mRNA molecules to the central nervous system is challenging as they need to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach into the brain.

Here we design and synthesize 72 BBB-crossing lipids fabricated by conjugating BBB-crossing modules and amino lipids, and use them to assemble BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery.

Screening and structure optimization studies resulted in a lead formulation that has substantially higher mRNA delivery efficiency into the brain than those exhibited by FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles.

Studies in distinct mouse models show that these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles can transfect neurons and astrocytes of the whole brain after intravenous injections, being well tolerated across several dosage regimens. Moreover, these nanoparticles can deliver mRNA to human brain ex vivo samples.

Overall, these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to neurons and astrocytes in broad brain regions, thereby being a promising platform to treat a range of central nervous system diseases."
The Ketamine-Fueled ‘Psychedelic Slumber Parties’ That Get Tech Execs Back on Track - WIRED,"Can stuffed animals, rose petals, and injections of an Elon Musk–approved dissociative drug help Silicon Valley leaders out of a rut? These women say yes.",https://www.wired.com/story/ketamine-psychedelic-slumber-parties-tech-executives/,health,"“Ketamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind,” Elon Musk told an interviewer last year. The unelected man currently gutting US federal programs isn’t the only one who thinks so. Ketamine, approved decades ago as a surgical anesthetic and long used as a party drug, is the off-label mental-health treatment of the moment. It induces a “trancelike” state of “sensory isolation,” researchers say, and may temporarily boost the brain’s neuroplasticity—which, in theory, makes mental ruts easier to escape. At the same time, ketamine abuse can be deadly, and the drug remains illegal to use without a prescription. (Musk says he has one from “an actual, real doctor.”)

WIRED spoke to the cofounders of an organization that offers ketamine-assisted leadership coaching in the San Francisco Bay Area. The two speakers are identified by pseudonyms, which they selected for themselves. Aria Stone has a doctorate in psychology. Shuang Shuang is a spiritual coach. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Your Next Job Testimonials from tomorrow's workforce.

Shuang Shuang: We fast-track coaching by really locking it in with the psychedelics. We deliver it to you on a cellular level.

Aria Stone: With ketamine, there’s a 24- to 48-hour window of optimization, when people’s brains are literally more neuroplastic, which is why this is a multiday experience.

SS: We call it an off-site, not a retreat, because we’re not retreating from anything. We don’t do them big—nine or 10 clients—partially due to the importance of confidentiality. Our clientele is primarily CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, CFOs, C-level founders of startups. All of them are in a pressure cooker.

AS: Those are the kind of leaders that come—people who have achieved so much in their life, and they’re like, “OK, what’s the next horizon? Because I’ve checked pretty much every box.”

SS: Here are all the loneliest people. They have to lead and go through so many things by themselves. They can come and see that they’re not alone, and let go of the burden of being so protected all the time. They just want to be people.

“There’s this huge teddy bear holding a cup of the intramuscular ketamine.”

To screen clients, we ask about their medical and psychological background, whether they currently work with a therapist, and whether they’ve participated in a group program before. We would slow down around accepting someone with a significant trauma history, someone who is actively suicidal or has a history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the latter of which can be contraindicated with ketamine.

AS: And since ketamine can certainly be misused, a history of substance abuse would also give us pause.

SS: Our off-site costs $2,600 for three days, plus a $350 fee for a medical assessment and ketamine prescription. Meals are included, but transportation and lodging are not.

AS: Over the course of a three-day off-site in the Mission, in a beautiful, open space with a tall ceiling, clients have two ketamine experiences. When you walk in, all of these BackJack floor chairs are in a circle. In the center are candles. We put a rose on every seat, and information about what to expect.

SS: The vibes are witchy.

The first day is about settling into that radical acceptance, welcoming what’s coming to us on ketamine. Our opening ceremony could include movement, dancing, getting into the body, or we might just talk to each other about what’s alive for us. We have an intention-setting session."
Why it’s easier for some people to remember dreams than others - New York Post ,Only 11% of Americans say they almost always remember their dreams.,https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/health/why-its-easier-for-some-people-to-remember-dreams-than-others/,health,"It’s hard to live your dreams — especially when you can’t remember them.

Dream recall is the ability to summon at least some significant details from a dream once you wake up. Only 11% of Americans almost always remember their dreams — it’s a mystery why it’s easier for some than others.

Now, researchers in Italy say they have identified the individual characteristics and external factors that can influence the odds of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience.

“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits and sleep dynamics interact,” said lead study author Giulio Bernardi, a professor in general psychology at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.

What’s a dream?

A dream is a sequence of images, thoughts, emotions and sensations that our mind generates while we sleep. All of us dream every night.

Dreaming is believed to help us process our emotions, store memories, strengthen our brain’s neural connections, reduce stress, solve problems and think creatively.

Vivid dreams happen most often during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, when the brain is particularly active.

Some people, especially women, said they were able to recall their dreams more often during the COVID-19 pandemic, which researchers attributed to greater stress, depression and sleep disruptions.

How did the study work?

4 Study participants had to report daily for 15 days if they dreamed or not and to describe the dream if they did. ÃÂ ÃÂµÃÂ³ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂ° Ãâ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ¾ÃâÃÂµÃÂµÃÂ²ÃÂ° – stock.adobe.com

The IMT research was conducted from 2020 to 2024.

Over 200 participants, between 18 and 70, took psychological tests and answered questionnaires before and after the trial to determine their anxiety levels, their interest in dreams and their tendency to get distracted.

They were given a voice recorder to report daily for 15 days if they dreamed or not and to describe the dream if they did.

Each participant also wore an actigraph, a device that detects sleep duration, quality and disturbances.

Which factors increase the chances of better dream recall?

4 Younger people tend to be able to better recall their dreams, according to the new study. Researchers suggested there may be age-related changes in memory processes during sleep. chaiwattc – stock.adobe.com

The researchers proposed that the people most likely to recall dreams:

Have a positive attitude about dreams

Tend to let their minds wander

Spend longer periods of time in light sleep

Live in warmer weather — participants reported lower dream recall during winter

Are younger — older people often have “white dreams,” the vague sense of having dreamed without concrete evidence

“These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness,” Bernardi said.

What’s next?

The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Communications Psychology.

Valentina Elce, an IMT researcher and first study author, said data collected in this project will allow the team to research unusual changes in dream patterns and their possible significance for predicting or identifying medical or psychological conditions."

For those who hate the winter, this has been an especially tough and long season. The Arctic Air is blasting the Empire State and wind chills are well below zero from Buffalo to Albany.

However, it won'y be too long before the spring does get here and most people get out of the house and head to great outdoors!

If you own property, or recently purchased some land in New York State, now is the time to get a plan in place to mark the borders on your land to keep trespassers away.

What The Law Says

New York State has some very specific laws pertaining to trespassing and what the responsibilities are of landowners.

For example, the ""11X11"" law. New York State makes it clear that there are specific dimensions that are required for the size posted signs need to be.

""Signs must be a minimum of 11 inches by 11 inches. They also must bear the name and address of the owner, lawful occupant, or other person or organization authorized to post the area"".

There are some hefty fines in place for those who are caught trespassing here in New York State. However, for those who own the land, it is very frustrating to pay taxes, keep it posted and still have people wonder on private property.

Quick Reminder

As the summer approaches, it is a good idea to remember that unless you are on New York State property, you are on private property and should ask for permission before you enter."
"How to be fit past 100 without going to the gym, according to 6 centenarians - Business Insider",Exercising is great for longevity. Making movement social is one of the tips for staying fit centenarians shared with Business Insider.,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-fit-without-going-to-gym-centenarians-2025-2,health,"Business Insider has talked to lots of centenarians about what they think has helped them live past 100.

Many have kept fit without going to the gym.

Building movement into daily life is one of their top tips.

If you hate working out but want the life-lengthening benefits of exercise, you may find it reassuring that many centenarians Business Insider has spoken with have never set foot in a gym.

To some degree, the type of exercise you do seems to matter less than how often you do it. Nathan K. LeBrasseur, a physiologist who studies healthy aging, previously told BI that people should do an exercise they enjoy because then they're more likely to keep it up.

Deborah Szekely, 102, who runs a ranch in Baja California, Mexico, agrees. ""What matters is that you're pushing yourself enough to feel it, getting your heart rate up, and breaking a sweat. If you get really huffy puffy, you're doing a good job,"" she told BI.

And it's never too late to get active. A 2023 study by researchers at Duke Kunshan University in China found that participants over the age of 80 who were physically active were more likely to live longer than those who were inactive — even if they started later in life.

Here's how centenarians who talked to BI said they stayed fit.

Deborah Szekely is 102 years old and works at her health resort, Rancho La Puerta. Rancho La Puerta

1) Walking

As people get older, it can get harder to do some types of exercise — but some centenarians can keep walking. Louise Jean Signore, New York's second oldest person at 112, stopped swimming, biking, line dancing, and playing bowls when her health deteriorated, but she still tries to get her steps in, whether that's outside or in her hallway.

Szekely also walks at least a mile each day in local parks, while Pearl Taylor, who lived in Ohio until she died aged 103 , walked around her local Walmart for two hours every weekend.

Walking is a low-intensity exercise but still has plenty of health benefits. A 2023 review of studies published in the journal GeroScience found that walking appeared to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cognitive impairment, and dementia, while also improving mental well-being, sleep, and longevity.

2) Cycle instead of driving

Martin McEvilly, who was Ireland's oldest man when he died at 108 last October, never owned a car. Instead, his bicycle was his primary form of transport until he was 99. Even once he stopped cycling everywhere, he continued to use a stationary exercise bike until he was 105.

A 2023 review of studies published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living found a link between cycling regularly and better mental well-being, a lower risk of dying from any cause, and a lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.

3) Make exercise social

Katie MacRae, a 107-year-old who lives in Queensland, Australia, regularly plays bowls with her fellow care home residents. And 103-year-old Janet Gibbs played golf until she was 86.

As well as physical benefits, the social aspect of exercising could also help us live longer. Professor Rose Anne Kenny, the chair of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and the head of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, argues that socializing is more important for longevity than exercise or a healthy diet.

4) Build exercise into your job or hobbies

Many centenarians did hard physical jobs, such as McEvilly who worked on his family farm. His days were spent cutting up turf for fuel, trimming plants, collecting water, and gathering moss to use for animal bedding.

Enjoy occasional treats in moderation without derailing your healthy eating plan

With rising incidents of heart failure among youngsters mainly, it is extremely necessary to focus on the lifestyle habits that we are following.Recently, Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez shared few important and simple tips to keep the heart healthy.He shares small doable activities like walking, avoiding sitting for too long, etc. for a healthy heart.""Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long,"" says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.For those who are on medication for high blood pressure, he urges them to check the readings and monitor the numbers and make sure the factors are well under control.The cardiologist shares the following tips for a healthy heart:Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy body. They help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are excellent sources of iron and folate, while citrus fruits provide immune-boosting vitamin C. Berries, carrots, and tomatoes are packed with antioxidants that fight inflammation and oxidative stress. Aim for a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient intake.Whole grains, including brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat, oats, and barley, are rich in fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like magnesium and selenium. Whole grains contain bran and germ, unlike refined grains, which contain the essential nutrients and aid digestion. Diets with high fiber help control blood sugar, reduce cholesterol, and aid in gut health. Daily inclusion of whole grains provides sustained energy and enhanced digestive function.Not all fats are bad. Healthy fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats contribute to heart health, brain activity, and cell growth. Sources of good fat are olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocados. These reduce the levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) but raise the level of good cholesterol (HDL), reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, trans fats and too much saturated fats, which usually occur in processed food and fried foods, should be avoided.Protein is essential for repair of muscles, immune system functioning, and overall body maintenance. Opting for lean protein sources promotes healthy weight and chronic disease prevention. Good choices include skinless poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans), and low-fat dairy products. Fish, especially fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which benefit brain and heart function. Balancing plant and animal proteins guarantees nutrient adequacy.Increased intake of salt has been associated with high blood pressure, heart conditions, and kidney disease. Salt is present in large quantities in processed foods, fast foods, and prepared foods. Fresh and home-cooked foods should be chosen to limit salt consumption. Instead of using salt, vegetables, lemon juice, garlic, or spices may be used as seasonings for food. Even reading the label on foods that contain sodium may assist in maintaining a healthier lifestyle.Overeating, even healthy foods, can lead to weight gain and metabolic disorders. Being mindful of portion sizes helps regulate calorie intake and maintain a balanced diet . Using smaller plates, serving controlled portions, and eating slowly can prevent overeating. Listening to hunger and fullness cues is also essential for better digestion and weight management.A well-structured daily menu should emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Planning meals in advance helps ensure a balanced nutrient intake and reduces the temptation to opt for unhealthy choices. A typical meal could include a bowl of oatmeal with nuts and fruit for breakfast, a salad with lean protein and whole grains for lunch, and a vegetable-rich stir-fry with quinoa or brown rice for dinner.Completely eliminating favorite foods can lead to cravings and unhealthy eating patterns. Instead of strict restrictions, allow occasional treats in moderation. Whether it's a piece of dark chocolate, a small serving of dessert, or a few chips, enjoying indulgent foods mindfully prevents feelings of deprivation and helps sustain long-term healthy eating habits .""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" believes the cardiologist. ""No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease,"" he adds."
3 Best Foods to Burn Visceral Belly Fat - BOXROX,"Visceral fat, the deep abdominal fat that surrounds internal organs, poses significant health risks, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic",https://www.boxrox.com/3-best-foods-to-burn-visceral-belly-fat/,health,"Visceral fat, the deep abdominal fat that surrounds internal organs, poses significant health risks, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which is stored under the skin, visceral fat is more metabolically active and releases inflammatory markers that contribute to insulin resistance and chronic disease.

While exercise and overall caloric balance play vital roles in fat reduction, specific foods have been scientifically proven to aid in targeting visceral fat. This article explores three of the best foods for reducing visceral belly fat, backed by research.

1. Fatty Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been extensively studied for their role in reducing visceral fat. Omega-3 fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and promote fat oxidation. A study published in the journal PLOS One found that individuals who consumed omega-3-rich foods had lower levels of visceral fat compared to those who did not (Kaushik et al., 2019).

Omega-3 fatty acids also regulate cortisol levels, a stress hormone linked to increased abdominal fat storage. High cortisol levels, particularly in response to chronic stress, contribute to visceral fat accumulation. Research in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation significantly reduces cortisol levels, thereby mitigating fat storage around the abdomen (Delarue et al., 2003).

Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids enhance mitochondrial efficiency, increasing the body’s ability to oxidise fat for energy. This process directly impacts visceral fat reduction, as shown in a study published in Obesity that found a significant decrease in visceral fat in individuals consuming omega-3-rich diets (Buckley & Howe, 2009).

2. High-Fibre Foods: Legumes and Whole Grains

Dietary fibre, particularly soluble fibre, is a crucial component in the fight against visceral fat. Foods such as lentils, chickpeas, oats, and barley are rich in soluble fibre, which slows digestion and promotes satiety, reducing overall caloric intake. A study published in Obesity found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fibre intake, visceral fat accumulation decreased by 3.7% over five years (Hairston et al., 2011).

Soluble fibre also plays a role in modulating gut microbiota, which influences fat metabolism and storage. Research published in Cell Metabolism found that an improved gut microbiome composition, driven by increased fibre intake, led to lower visceral fat levels (Zhao et al., 2018). The fermentation of soluble fibre by gut bacteria produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which regulate fat metabolism and reduce inflammation.

Whole grains, particularly those rich in beta-glucans like oats and barley, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the postprandial glucose spike, preventing excess fat storage. A study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that individuals consuming whole grains had significantly lower visceral fat than those consuming refined grains (McKeown et al., 2010).

3. Green Tea and Catechins

Green tea is widely recognised for its fat-burning properties, primarily due to its high catechin content. Catechins, a type of flavonoid, enhance fat oxidation and thermogenesis, leading to increased energy expenditure and visceral fat reduction. A meta-analysis published in The International Journal of Obesity concluded that individuals consuming green tea extract experienced significant reductions in visceral fat compared to control groups (Hursel et al., 2011).

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most potent catechin in green tea, inhibits an enzyme that breaks down norepinephrine, a hormone that promotes fat breakdown. This prolongs norepinephrine’s activity, increasing fat mobilisation and oxidation. A study in The Journal of Nutrition found that daily consumption of green tea extract led to a 7.7% reduction in visceral fat over 12 weeks (Nagao et al., 2005).

Green tea also enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, preventing excess visceral fat accumulation. Research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that green tea catechins improved metabolic rate and reduced body fat, particularly in the abdominal region (Venables et al., 2008).

Key Takeaways

Best Foods for Burning Visceral Fat Mechanism of Action Fatty Fish (Omega-3s) Reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers cortisol levels High-Fibre Foods (Legumes & Whole Grains) Enhances satiety, regulates gut microbiota, reduces insulin spikes Green Tea (Catechins) Increases fat oxidation, enhances thermogenesis, improves metabolic rate

For the study, conducted at the Los Angeles LGBT Center from April 2019 to July 2024, researchers analyzed electronic health record data on 2,083 patients who were prescribed DP over the study period. The center issued formal clinician guidance on DP use in October 2022. The aim of the study was to review patient demographics, STI testing history, use patterns, and short-term effectiveness of DP.

Nearly half of the patients were between 31 and 40 years of age (48.1%), over half were white (55.9%), 85.2% were gay or bisexual men, and 41.4% had a history of one or more STI diagnoses in the year prior to DP initiation. Nearly a quarter (24.5%) of DP patients received a prescription from January 1 to April 15, 2024.

Real-world efficacy matches clinical trial results

Among 1,115 patients with 6 months or more of DP use, cases of syphilis fell by 86.4%, chlamydia cases declined by 89.7%, and gonorrhea cases decreased by 54.7%. There was similar effectiveness for chlamydia and gonorrhea regardless of anatomic site (rectal or throat swabs or urine sample).

The study authors note that the reduction in bacterial STIs observed among DP users is similar to the results of the DoxyPEP trial conducted in San Francisco and Seattle. Results from that trial and another in France resulted in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending DP in 2024 for gay men and transgender women with a history of STIs.

The authors say that while DP has become ""an important and ever more widely used tool"" for bacterial STI transmission, important questions about possible tradeoffs or consequences of consistent use remain.

""Researchers should closely examine use patterns and establish quality improvement programs in all settings where DP use is recommended in order to minimize adverse outcomes while trying to achieve population impact on the STI and HIV syndemics,"" they concluded."
Third avian flu spillover reported in Arizona dairy herd; raw pet food sickens Oregon cats - University of Minnesota Twin Cities,,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/third-avian-flu-spillover-reported-arizona-dairy-herd-raw-pet-food-sickens,health,"For the second time in just over a week, national milk testing has identified another spillover of H5N1 avian influenza into dairy cows, with investigators linking detection to a herd in Arizona’s Maricopa County.

In other developments, agriculture officials in Oregon and Washington warned pet owners about the risk of raw pet food after tests on sick domestic cats from different households in Multnomah County linked the infections to contaminated food from the same company.

Also, against the backdrop of an ongoing surge of outbreaks in commercial poultry, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has conditionally approved an H5N2 avian flu vaccine made by Zoetis for use in poultry.

Arizona herd hadn’t shown symptoms when milk tested positive

Arizona officials announced on February 14 that the state’s agriculture department along with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have identified H5N1 in milk produced by a dairy herd in Maricopa County.

Officials said the virus is the D1.1 genotype and that the cattle haven’t shown symptoms so far. The detections come on the heels of a similar detection through milk sampling in Nevada, which led to the detection of the virus in dairy herds in Churchill County. Clinical signs in those cows didn’t develop until after the detections. Shortly after, Nevada reported its first H5N1 infection in a human, a dairy worker who was exposed to the sick cows.

D1.1, circulating widely in North American wild birds, has fueled a surge in poultry outbreaks, affecting both commercial and backyard flocks. It is different than the B3.13 genotype implicated in most other dairy cow outbreaks over the past year.

APHIS said in a February 14 statement that detection of the D1.1 genotype isn’t surprising, given its prevalence. It added that sequencing suggests that it represents a separate introduction to dairy cattle, now the third of its kind in dairy cattle. “This finding may indicate an increased risk of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] introduction into dairies through wild bird exposure,” APHIS said, urging dairy farmers to tighten biosecurity and to report cattle illnesses and unusual sick or dead wildlife to state veterinarians.

In its latest update on detections in dairy cattle, APHIS today reported 5 more confirmations, which includes the Arizona herd, with the others from California. The new confirmations push the national total to 972, including 747 from California.

Another raw pet food brand tied to Oregon cat illnesses

Echoing results from earlier California investigations into H5N1 infections in domestic cats, an investigation by agriculture departments in Oregon and Washington has renewed warnings about feeding pets raw food after their investigation into two cat illnesses in Oregon found that the pets were exposed to the same raw pet food brand.

The cats were from different households in Multnomah County. The owners, after consulting with veterinarians, humanely euthanized the cats due to illness severity. Oregon officials found the cats both ate the same type of raw food before they got sick. Oregon officials obtained samples from the cats and unopened food containers, and Washington officials tested samples from unopened containers. State and federal testing confirmed H5N1 in cat and food samples.

The findings prompted a consumer alert from the Washington State Department of Agriculture about the risk of avian flu in certain lots of pet food made by Wild Coast Raw, based in Olympia, Washington. The alert applies to two lots of feline formula boneless free-range chicken formula sold in 24-ounce plastic containers.

Vaccine approval may add another outbreak tool

Meanwhile, New Jersey-based Zoetis on February 14 announced that the USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics has conditionally approved a license for the company’s killed-virus H5N2 avian flu vaccine for use in chickens.

It said the decision to use the vaccine rests with national regulatory officials and the poultry industry.

Mahesh Kumar, PhD, the company’s senior vice president for global biologics research and development, said the company has been working on an update to its earlier vaccine since H5N1 first began circulating in US poultry in early 2022. The company had received an earlier contract for the National Veterinary Stockpile. The vaccine was used in 2023 to protect endangered California condors.

Last year, legislators from South Dakota urged US officials to launch discussions about updating trade agreements that would allow potential use of poultry vaccines. Though some countries, including China, routinely vaccinate poultry, others have held back due to concerns that vaccine use could mask ongoing circulation. Thus, many countries bar the import of poultry where vaccines are used in commercial settings.

In a policy brief at the end of 2023, experts from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) said the rapid spread of the virus requires a review of existing control strategies, given that current tools might not be enough.

More poultry outbreaks in 4 states

Amid an ongoing surge in poultry outbreaks, APHIS today confirmed more H5N1 detections in poultry in four states, including Indiana, which has two more large outbreaks at layer farms and events at a turkey farm and a backyard facility. The virus was confirmed at turkey farms in Iowa and Ohio, as well as at a commercial farm in California.

The outbreaks have led to the loss of more than 162 million birds across all 50 states and Puerto Rico since early 2022, and resulted in ongoing egg shortages and high egg prices."

Nike is in a slump. It’s hired Kim Kardashian to help - CNN,"Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company.

Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.

Nike is partnering with Kardashian for a new brand called “NikeSkims,” the company and fashion mogul jointly announced Tuesday. The collection, which is based on her popular shapewear line, “will disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry with best-in-class innovation in service of all women athletes,” according to a press release.

Few details were initially made available, including pricing and images. However, the brand will first roll out in the United States this spring online and at “select retail locations,” with a global launch planned in 2026.

The new collection is a first for Nike, which hasn’t partnered with an outside company before to create a new brand, rather relying on acquisitions or tapping popular athletes (i.e. Michael Jordan) for apparel. Financial terms of the brand wasn’t revealed.

Nike said that Skims “proposed a shared product line,” but suggested “something even bigger,” thus the creation of NikeSkims. “More than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories,” the press release stated.

The new brand will help Nike be more relevant in the activewear category, helping it compete against Lululemon and Alo, which is an area “where it has been flagging and playing second fiddle,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.

“In theory, Nike should have all the skills needed to drive its own brand in womenswear, but the reality is it has lost some of its ability to story tell, innovate and wow consumers,” Saunders told CNN. “Partnering with Skims remedies some of those weaknesses.”

Skims has been a major success story for Kardashian with the privately held company valued at a whopping $4 billion as of July 2023. The brand is aimed at everyday wear expanding beyond women with a men’s lineup and inking sponsorships with the NBA, WNBA and Team USA for the most recent Olympics in Paris.

Meanwhile, Nike faces tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Plus, customers are changing their behavior, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike recently changed CEOs to help turn it around.

Nike (NKE) reported an 8% drop in sales in its most recent quarter, signaling the company is still struggling. However, shares perked up following the Kardashian news — rising nearly 3% — in early trading. Meanwhile, Lululemon (LULU) shares fell nearly the same amount."
"Ethan Hawke: ‘When We Prioritize Money at All Costs, What We Get Is Generic Material’ - Variety","Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film ""Blue Moon.""",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/ethan-hawke-when-we-prioritize-money-we-get-generic-art-1236311507/,entertainment,"Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film “Blue Moon” on Tuesday, saying that this diminishes when money is prioritized.

“Audiences have to care. They don’t sell. You guys, the community, has to make it important. For offensive art to have a place in our conversation, it has to be cared about,” Hawke said. “And when we prioritize money at all costs, what we get is generic material that appeals to the most amount of people and we’re told that’s the best. It’s a dance we all do together. If you love offensive art and you want it, demand it. Right now, people don’t think they’ll make any money off it so it doesn’t get made.”

The idea of “offensive art” is a theme in “Blue Moon,” which follows lyricist Lorenz Hart (Hawke), Richard Rodgers’ former creative partner, as he struggles with alcoholism and depression on the opening night of “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers’ first musical with Hammerstein. After opening night, Hart criticizes the show for being inoffensive and having too happy of an ending.

Added Linklater, “Offensive times conjure up offensive art maybe. But movies particularly have always been escapism, and in our movie he’s accusing ‘Oklahoma!’ of being escapist in the middle of the horrors of WWII. So I don’t know, I think most human psyches want to escape a bit. There’s probably less offensive art now than there has been in the past.”

“Blue Moon” marks Hawke and Linklater’s first film together in over a decade, since 2014’s “Boyhood.” Alongside Hawke as Hart, “Blue Moon” also stars Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Bobby Cannavale as a bartender named Eddie.

Hawke and Linklater have now worked on nine feature films together over the course of their careers, including the “Before” trilogy, “The Newton Boys” and “Fast Food Nation.” At a Venice Film Festival talk last year, Hawke discussed their collaboration and the genesis of “Blue Moon,” saying Linklater wanted to make the movie 12 years ago but said the actor was “still too attractive.”

“He’s like, ‘Cool, we’re going to make it, but we need to wait a while.’ Why do we need to wait a while? He said, ‘You’re still too attractive. We gotta wait til you’re a little less attractive.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Hawke said. “He’s like, ‘Just trust me. Let’s just put it in a drawer, and every couple of years let’s read it and see if we’re ready or not.’”

“Blue Moon” premieres at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday night."

Instagram Meghan's lifestyle brand is now going to be called 'As Ever'

Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever. Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post.

The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title.

If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as ""whatever"". Appropriately, she signed off her own post: ""As ever, Meghan."""

Lately, it’s been challenging to get close to the people around you — you’re so different from each other. You can come up with plenty of reasons why it’s not even worth it to try. But when the sun enters Pisces this morning, those differences won’t seem so insurmountable.Today, it’ll become possible to find surprising common ground with others, and to connect on a deep and genuine level.

Aries Daily Horoscope

Today you might be filled with wistfulness, nostalgia, and maybe a bit of regret. If you let yourself reminisce and reflect, deeply buried emotions could come up. While your natural tendency might be to immediately do something about whatever you’re feeling now, try to be patient. You’re likely only to cause problems for yourself if you rush to take action without giving yourself any time to process. Sitting with your feelings probably doesn’t sound particularly useful or exciting, but for now, it could be the best use of your time.

Taurus Daily Horoscope

You can be incredibly generous with the people in your life. When they need help, you offer what you can, whether that’s resources, time, or just a listening ear. You’d never judge or resent your friends for needing support — but you tend to think that you shouldn’t ever need a hand, and that successes somehow don’t “count” unless you achieved them on your own. Today, it’s time to recognize that you’re being unfair to yourself. When you need help, you’re only holding yourself back by not asking for it.

Gemini Daily Horoscope

Sometimes, you get the sense that you’re falling behind. You imagine that you should be much farther along in your career, or that your personal life shouldn’t be so messy, or simply that you should feel more mature and more capable than you do. Today, remember that you’re on your own timeline, not anyone else’s. If you compare yourself to the people around you, you’ll inevitably feel inadequate, but if you trust that you’re moving at the right pace for you, it’ll be much easier to get where you want to go.

Cancer Daily Horoscope

You’re brave and determined, but at a certain point, you get tired of meeting challenge after challenge with courage and integrity. Today, you might feel particularly drained; you just want to hide from it all. Right now though, the best way to care for yourself isn’t to retreat from the world around you, but to engage with it. You don’t need to go on big adventures if you’re not up for it, but seeing new sights and interacting with people will fill your cup more than sitting at home.

Leo Daily Horoscope

You tend to express your opinions forcefully, and you stand by them, often doubling down when others challenge you. But even if you’re right almost all of the time, there will still be instances when you misjudge people, jump to the wrong conclusion, and say things you regret. Your pride makes it hard to admit when you’ve made a mistake, but today, it might get a bit easier to show yourself grace. You’re not responsible for knowing all the answers, only for being willing to learn and grow.

Virgo Daily Horoscope

You often underestimate the effect you have on the people around you. It might seem like they aren’t paying attention to you, like they’re only half-listening when you share your ideas — but in fact, you hold more sway than you realize. Your friends look up to you, they want you to think well of them, and they take your feedback seriously — even if they don’t always show it. Don’t hesitate to speak up today; the people in your life are listening more closely than you realize.

Libra Daily Horoscope

The harder you work, the more you care about getting results. It’s hard to see the point of putting real effort into a project if you’re not going to get anywhere, or investing time into a relationship that might not work out. It’s reasonable to feel this way; the problem is that you can’t always control outcomes — especially when other people are in the mix. Today, focus on the process. If you take each step with intention, you’ll be able to hold your head up high whatever happens in the end.

Scorpio Daily Horoscope

It’s all too easy to become convinced that your actions don’t matter — the world is vast and you’re only one person; you struggle to see how anything you do could make a difference. But thinking this way helps nobody, so today, push back against it. You don’t need to make grand, impressive gestures — simply connecting with other people, and putting your energy to good use instead of letting it wither away inside you, is enough. It’s not about convincing anyone else that you’re powerful, but about reminding yourself.

Sagittarius Daily Horoscope

In general, you’re a big-picture kind of thinker; you’re good at seeing the patterns that your more detail-oriented friends tend to miss, and you’re good at coming up with grand, unifying theories about the world. Today though, remember there are exceptions to every rule. People won’t always behave the way you expect them to, and your own thoughts and feelings often break the mold, too. Give everyone, including yourself, the space to be who they actually are, not who you think they’re supposed to be.

Capricorn Daily Horoscope

You probably aren’t the sort of person who enjoys arguing for its own sake, but you’re not one to shy away from it, either. If someone is unfairly criticizing you, you’ll fight back; if they’re making claims that you know are untrue, you’ll set the record straight. You care about being right, and you want everyone else to recognize that you know what you’re talking about. Sometimes, though, it gets exhausting to feel like you always have to prove yourself. Today, try to put more energy into connecting with other people than in deciding who’s “right.”

Aquarius Daily Horoscope

Your own comfort isn’t generally a top priority for you — maybe because you’re too busy ruminating on bigger ideas to worry about something so trivial, or maybe because you imagine that you don’t really deserve to feel at ease. But today, make an effort to be kind to yourself. Give a bit of extra attention to your emotional and physical needs. Neglecting yourself won’t make you wiser or a “better person” — it’ll only make everything else more difficult.

Pisces Daily Horoscope

When you aren’t sure what kind of life you want to live, or how you should be spending your time, it’s only natural to look to the people around you for guidance. Navigating the world can be confusing, and it can be helpful to see how others do it. Today, just make sure you’re not putting too much stock in the actions of other people: they’re on their own paths, and your job isn’t to follow them, but to find yours. You’re wiser than you sometimes give yourself credit for, so trust your instincts.

'SNL' Alum Victoria Jackson Slams Tom Hanks MAGA Skit as 'Stupid' - TMZ,"Tom Hanks has found himself in hot water after poking fun at Trump supporters on ""SNL"" this past weekend – and now, one of the show's own alums is jumping in to slam him.",https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/18/snl-alum-victoria-jackson-slams-tom-hanks-maga-skit/,entertainment,"Tom Hanks has found himself in hot water after poking fun at Trump supporters on 'SNL' this past weekend – and now, one of the show's own alums is jumping in to slam him.

Victoria Jackson, a staunch Trump supporter, is making her anger known to TMZ, pointing us to a post by political commentator Link Lauren, who calls out the ""MAGA = racist"" trope as ""downright disgusting"" -- a sentiment VJ says summarizes her feelings.

Victoria -- who was a cast member from '86 to '92 -- calls the whole thing ""stupid,"" adding she was also offended by the sexual vulgarity on the show.

Tom Hanks just came out on SNL in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a black man’s hand.



This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. SNL is an unfunny show… pic.twitter.com/PlSc7gmiJ0 — Link Lauren (@itslinklauren) February 17, 2025 @itslinklauren

Victoria, who was on the red carpet at last night's show, notes another ex-cast member next to her laughed at the ""crude jokes,"" sarcastically adding the show seemed to have something for everyone -- but then quips, ""Did anyone make fun of the Kamala supporters?!""

In Link’s X post -- which Victoria says perfectly captured her feelings -- he slammed Hanks’ skit where he played a Trump supporter who acted like he was scared to shake a Black man’s hand -- calling it the reason why the show’s ratings ""are in the gutter."""
'The Brutalist' Director Brady Corbet Says He Made No Money From the Film - Hollywood Reporter,"“I've spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can't pay their rent,"" Corbet said. ""I mean, that's a real thing.""",http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-brutalist-brady-corbet-made-no-money-1236139785/,entertainment,"The Brutalist director Brady Corbet said this week he “made zero dollars” on his Oscar-nominated film.

“I just directed three advertisements in Portugal,” Corbet said during an appearance on WTF With Marc Maron. “It’s the first time that I had made any money in years.”

Corbet went on to elaborate that he and his wife (and creative partner) Mona Fastvold, “made zero dollars on the last two films that we made.”

Before The Brutalist, Corbet and Fastvold made 2018’s Vox Lux. The Brutalist earned 10 nominations for this year’s Academy Awards, including best actor for Adrien Brody, best supporting actress for Felicity Jones, best director for Corbet and best picture.

When Maron asked Corbet to clarify his comments about payment, the director said, “Yes. Actually, zero. We had to just sort of live off of a paycheck from three years ago.”

The financial toll is not exclusive to Corbet, he said. “I’ve spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can’t pay their rent. I mean, that’s a real thing.”

The director went on to note that filmmakers are “not paid to be promoting a film,” and that “if you look at certain films that premiered in Cannes, that was almost a year ago … I mean, our film premiered in September. So I’ve been doing this for six months. And had zero income because I don’t have any time to go to work. I can’t even take a writing job at the moment.”

Corbet said the lengthy press circuit feels like “a six-month interrogation,” later saying he completed 90 interviews last week.

“It’s seven days a week,” he said. “It’s boundless. It’s constant travel, and you’re also working Saturdays and Sundays. I haven’t had a day off since the Christmas break, and that was also only four days.”"

"Bethenny Frankel praises Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds 'SNL 50' appearance - New York Post ",A “bravo” from Bethenny.,https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/entertainment/bethenny-frankel-praises-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-snl-50-appearance/,entertainment,"A “bravo” from Bethenny.

Bethenny Frankel has praised Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for showing up to the “SNL” 50th anniversary special on Sunday amid their ongoing legal fight with Lively’s “It Ends With Us” co-star and director, Justin Baldoni.

In the first of two videos posted to her Instagram on Monday, the former “Real Housewives of New York” star, 54, also lauded “SNL” for including the stars in the special, adding that the couple’s decision to poke fun at their battle with Baldoni was “nothing short of genius.”

“Absolutely brilliant of ‘SNL’ to invite and include Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively to lean into the humor,” Frankel began. “They are the epicenter of pop culture. It is the zeitgeist. Bullseye.”

She continued, “And for Ryan and Blake to participate is nothing short of genius, because the only way to weather a storm is to go straight through it.”

“And as I keep saying, no one knows what actually happened,” the Skinny Girl founder added, referring to Lively and Baldoni’s contradictory claims about the drama that unfolded behind the scenes during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

“So all of this speculation is a tricky and risky business. But that was very smart. Bravo,” Frankel concluded.

Reynolds nodded to his and Lively’s drama with Baldoni an hour into “SNL 50” during a segment where Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took questions from the star-studded audience in Rockefeller Center’s Studio 8H.

“Ryan Reynolds, how’s it going?” Poehler, 53, asked.

Reynolds then quipped, “Why? What have you heard?”

After facing criticism for her remarks in the comments, Frankel posted another clip, in which she declared she “is tripling down.”

“So many comments on ‘SNL’ and I am tripling down and saying that ‘SNL’ was nothing short of brilliant for having them on last night,” she told viewers. “It’s marketing genius.”

“They are the epicenter. They are the zeitgeist that is popular culture. They often have disruptive people on,” Frankel said of the sketch comedy show.”They talk about disruptive topics They will have both political candidates on. They will have people mocking both political candidates. So from their standpoint, it was nothing short of brilliant.”

Turning to Lively and Reynolds, the reality TV star said, “Whether you like them or not, [it] was smart of Blake and Ryan to go [to ‘SNL 50’].”

Frankel did, however, point out that she was speaking only from a marketing perspective, alluding to the allegations of sexual harassment Lively has leveled against Baldoni and the domestic violence at the center of the story in “It Ends With Us.”

“Now there’s a conversation about it being tone-deaf because of the topic. A very sensitive topic, which was also a complaint at the premiere that she was marketing hair and drinking at a movie premiere about S.A. [sexual assault],” she said, alluding to complaints about Lively marketing a new haircare line when “It Ends With Us” was released and including specialty cocktails from her alcoholics drink company at the premiere.

“So that’s a separate conversation,” Frankel stressed. “But from a marketing standpoint, it was a great idea on everyone’s part.

Referring to social media sleuths, she added, “Not everyone lives in the bowels of Tik-Tok reading every single legal document and knows every single thing that you guys all know.”

“Even Candace Owens would likely agree that ‘SNL’ was brilliant from a marketing standpoint,” Frankel said of the conservative commentator, who has been a vocal critic of Reynolds and Lively.

“She may not like it, and many of you don’t like the ‘ick’ of all of it, but that’s a touching story. From a marketing standpoint, it was smart.”

In December 2024, Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, accusing him of sexual harassment and orchestrating a public smear campaign against her.

Baldoni countersued her and Reynolds, 48, alleging defamation, extortion and more. Both stars have denied the other’s claims through their respective lawyers.

The legal war between Lively and Baldoni shows no sign of cooling down, with mediation seeming unlikely. On Friday, attorneys for both stars told Judge Lewis Liman that “settlement discussions would be premature,” according to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by Fox News Digital.

Lively and Baldoni’s trial is set for March 2026."

‘Last Week Tonight’ YouTube Release Delay Eliminated After John Oliver Called It “Massively Frustrating” - Deadline,'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. The episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/last-week-tonight-john-oliver-youtube-release-schedule-1236293211/,entertainment,"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. To fans’ surprise and delight, the episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.

This is a reversal of the release pattern HBO implemented last season, pushing the release of each new Sunday night episode’s main story on YouTube from the following Monday to the following Thursday in an effort to drive up subscribers to the Max streaming service. The move triggered backlash among fans and was called “massively frustrating” by Oliver.

HBO made an exception for Last Week Tonight‘s pre-election episode last November. That episode’s main segment, in which Oliver spoke of “the damage of a second Trump term,” urging everyone to vote for Kamala Harris, was released on YouTube shortly after the show had aired on the linear HBO network on the West Coast.

Watch on Deadline

At the time, HBO insiders stressed that the quick YouTube release was a one-off. It is now once again becoming the norm. The reversal decision, which Oliver had been advocating for, was made after data analysis didn’t reveal a significant increase in Max viewership after implementing the delay, sources said.

As it’s always been the case, only Last Week Tonight episodes’ main story will be released on YouTube. Last night’s episode was an exception as Oliver devoted the entire show to Donald Trump’s first month in office and the actions of Elon Musk, whom he called “a parasitic freak,” and his DOGE team.

As a result, the full episode was released on YouTube Sunday night."
Shakira’s tour back on track after Peru concert cancelled due to hospital admission - CNN,"Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/entertainment/shakira-hospital-peru-concert-cancelled-scli-intl/index.html,entertainment,"CNN —

Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.

Master Live, the company organizing Shakira’s concert in Lima, confirmed on Monday that the event scheduled for Monday, February 17 at the National Stadium in Peru’s capital at 8:15 p.m. local time will take place.

“We are pleased to inform that today’s concert will take place as normal. We want to thank Shakira for all the effort to make this show go ahead,” the statement from Master Live said.

Master Live added in its statement that they will announce the new date for the concert on Sunday that was canceled.

Posting to Instagram on Sunday, the singer previously said she had been taken to the emergency room and was advised to cancel the concert.

“The doctors whose care I am currently under have communicated that I am not in good enough condition to perform this evening,” she said.

“I am very sad to not be able to take (to) the stage today. I’ve been looking forward to reuniting with my incredible fans here in Peru,” Shakira said, adding that she hoped to be discharged soon.

“My team and the promoters are already working on a new date to communicate to you,” she added. So far there is no statement confirming that the singer has already left the hospital.

CNN is trying to contact Shakira’s team for more information. Meanwhile, Shakira’s social media has posted announcements of Monday’s concert and the list of songs that the Colombian singer is expected to sing tonight in Lima.

In a previous post, Shakira had thanked her Peruvian fans for a warm welcome to the country alongside a series of photos showing the singer greeting crowds of well wishers.

The singer recently embarked on a world tour and is set to play shows in various Latin American countries before embarking on a US leg of the tour starting May 13 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The tour is named “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,” or “Women Don’t Cry Anymore.”

Shakira is considered one of the most popular Latin American recording artists of the early 21st century.

However, she’s faced some controversy in recent years.

In November 2023, Shakira settled her tax evasion suit with the Spanish authorities.

The Grammy-winning singer admitted the charges against her and agreed to pay the amount owed in full and an additional fine, according to a statement released by the Barcelona prosecutor’s office at the time.

She paid a total of €17.5 million ($19 million), an amount composed of the taxes she owed plus interest, as well as a fine of €7.3 million ($8 million), the statement said."

Matt Damon Is Odysseus in First Image from Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Odyssey’ - IndieWire,Matt Damon plays the Greek soldier Odysseus in the first look at Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey.',https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/christopher-nolan-the-odyssey-first-look-matt-damon-1235096411/,entertainment,"On President’s Day, cinephiles got their first look at what just might be the most anticipated movie of 2026: Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey.” Universal took to its official social media accounts to release the first photo from the film, which shows Matt Damon in costume as Odysseus, the mythical Greek hero who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War.

Damon was one of the first cast members announced for Nolan’s film, and was soon joined by Tom Holland, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong’o, Benny Safdie, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, and Elliot Page. None of the casting announcements have been accompanied by news about who is playing which character from Homer’s epic poem — though that did not stop fans from speculating that Holland could be playing Odysseus’ son Telemachus — so Universal’s post marks the first official confirmation that Damon is playing the titular role.

Announced in December 2024, Nolan’s take on “The Odyssey” will be his 13th feature film. The box office success and Oscar dominance of “Oppenheimer” ensured that Nolan’s follow-up would be among the most coveted projects in Hollywood for actors and studios alike. Despite rumors of outreach from his former home Warner Bros., where he had worked for decades prior to “Oppenheimer,” Nolan opted to return to Universal for “The Odyssey.”

“Christopher Nolan’s next film ‘The Odyssey’ is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” the studio wrote in a post on X announcing the film in December. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.”

Nolan is unsurprisingly expected to shoot the film in IMAX formats, with production taking place in 2026 in Sicily, England, and Morocco. Many of the Sicilian islands are believed to be the locations Homer was referencing in his original text, as global borders have been significantly redrawn in the last three thousand years. It appears that Nolan is devoting the extensive Hollywood resources at his disposal to capturing the foundational text with an eye for both its epic scale and period detail.

A Universal release, “The Odyssey” opens in theaters on July 17, 2026."
Netflix Doc Reveals That Gabby Petito Called an Ex-Boyfriend for Comfort Hours Before Her Death - Variety,Netflix's 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' unpacks her disappearance and shows Gabby Petito called an ex-boyfriend for comfort hours before her death.,https://variety.com/2025/streaming/features/gabby-petito-american-murder-netflix-called-ex-boyfriend-before-death-1236310695/,entertainment,"It’s been three and a half years since Gabby Petito made headlines around the world after she vanished during a cross-country road trip she was taking with her fiance Brian Laundrie. Now, a new three-part docuseries, “American Murder: Gabby Petito,” goes beyond the headlines to reveal the reality of a 22-year-old woman enmeshed in an abusive relationship.

After Petito disappeared in August 2021, Laundrie returned to his parents’ house in North Port, Fla., where he refused to discuss Petito’s whereabouts. Laundrie’s refusal to speak to the police caused a media firestorm, which escalated when Petito’s body was found in Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest on Sept. 19, 2021. An autopsy concluded that Petito died by homicide. Laundrie, who was eventually revealed to be the killer, died by suicide in October 2021.

The series, directed by Julia Willoughby Nason and Michael Gasparro, features Peitito’s family and several of her close friends. Never-before-seen text messages, police body cam footage, and excerpts from Petito’s personal journal are also used to tell Petito’s story. Notably, the doc uses outtakes from Petito’s #Vanlife Vlog, which reveal that her happy, “Insta-perfect” face for social media was, especially in the last few weeks of her life, a facade.

Popular on Variety

The docuseries marks the third installment of Netflix’s “American Murder” franchise. “American Murder: The Family Next Door” streamed in 2020 and was followed by 2024’s “American Murder: Laci Peterson.”

Variety spoke to Willoughby Nason and Gasparro about accessing police body cam footage, Brian Laundrie’s parents, and what surprised them about the Petito case.

In the series, Gabby’s biological parents, as well as both of her stepparents, are very candid about their daughter and her murder, which seemed painful to recount. How did you convince the family to participate? Were they paid?

Gasparro: No. This was all about The Gabby Petito Foundation. Netflix doesn’t do a lot of action items, or cards (listing foundations) or anything like that because it’s a documentary. But we were able to get a clip into episode three where the family was able to talk about the foundation. So, the whole goal here is to push people towards The Gabby Petito Foundation, which helps bring awareness to domestic violence.

Did you find it difficult to ask to do those interviews since you were asking people to recount the worst weeks of their lives?

Willoughby Nason: We do very long interviews. So, we had time with the family to unpack things, to take breaks, and to slow down. Having done these kinds of interviews over the years with families who have lost loved ones, I see how hard it is for them to relive and tell these stories, but I think it’s also very healing and cathartic to be able to speak about what they are feeling on a daily basis because it doesn’t go away unfortunately for them.

Did the family provide you with all the unseen footage from Gabby’s #Vanlife Vlog?

Gasparro: Yes. When we met with her parents, they gave us all this stuff to go through, which included all of Gabby’s journals, all of her artwork, and then all the footage. Her curated #Vanlife footage proves what a great editor she was. She knew what she was doing, and she was very determined. But the (outtakes) allow you to unpack her journey, and that, to us, was amazing. It was really just a way to help tell the story through her.

In the series, it’s revealed that Gabby called an ex-boyfriend in the days leading up to her disappearance and on the day detectives think she was murdered. Did that surprise you?

Gasparro: Yes. We didn’t know about that. We didn’t know she had reached out to him during a vulnerable time (during her trip with Brian). She was obviously suffering. She trusted her ex and reached out. It was like a cry for help. We think that’s probably something that Brian caught wind of.

When Petito went missing, a snippet of the police bodycam footage captured on Aug. 12, 2021 in Moab, Utah of Gabby and Brian circulated in newsfeeds around the country. In your series, you reveal the entirety of the bodycam footage for the first time. How did you get all of that unseen footage?

Gasparro: Through FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests.

The footage is pretty infuriating. Did you ask the Moab police who were involved with the incident for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes, but they declined.

I’m assuming you also asked Brian’s parents – Christopher and Roberta Laundrie – for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes. They also declined. We had to respect that. You can only do so much, and we are not a news organization. We are not going to stand on their lawn and beg them to be on the series. For us, it was about telling Gabby’s story first and foremost. People tend to love to tell the story about the murderer, but we felt Gabby’s story was more important.

After this process, do you think Brian’s family knew that he murdered Gabby long before his confession letter was found?

Willoughby Nason: Based on the phone records that we highlight in the series, we know that Brian called his parents for almost an hour from Wyoming around the time Gabby went missing. I think to us, that really tips the hat that something was communicated there early on between his family. We don’t know what, but we do know that he told his dad, ‘Gabby’s gone, and I need a lawyer.’ We see in the phone records that the parents contacted a lawyer in Wyoming right after Brian’s call to them. So, it’s suspicious.

Were there any interesting things that you learned while making the film that you couldn’t fit into the series?

Willoughby Nason: I learned that Gabby was a prolific artist and that she was very industrious in terms of wanting to be an influencer and how to build this van. All of this was her idea.

Gasparro: There was an entire cross-country trip that they took prior to moving to Florida that we didn’t know about, but we had to move things along for the viewer.

Dr. Phil served as an executive producer on this series. How did that happen?

Gasparro: Sarah Carden (“Dr. Phil” senior supervising news producer) reached out to us and said that she loved “Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal,” which we made for Netflix in 2023. She told us that the (Petito) family, who had a relationship with Dr. Phil, wanted to tell their story because they hadn’t actually sat down or partnered with anybody to tell Gabby’s story. They had done sit-down interviews while everything was unpacking, but Sarah said that they wanted filmmakers like us to tell Gabby’s story.

“American Murder: Gabby Petito” is now streaming on Netflix."
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ Opened to $100 Million. Does a ‘B-’ CinemaScore Spell Trouble For Staying Power? - Variety,"""Captain America: Brave New World"" opened to a mighty $100 million. But how will the superhero sequel hold in subsequent weeks at the box office?",https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/captain-america-brave-new-world-box-office-staying-power-marvel-cinematic-universe-1236310075/,entertainment,"“Captain America: Brave New World” proves that Marvel hasn’t lost its mojo. The fourth “Captain America” installment, and the first in which Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield, delivered a mighty $100 million in its domestic debut over the extended Presidents Day weekend. The film added another $92.4 million overseas for a $192.4 million global tally, easily the best start of the (nascent) year.

Yet opening weekends are rarely a problem for Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. To wit: All 35 films in the sprawling comic book franchise have launched to No. 1, even the ones described by critics as a “pile of dirt.” So in the case of “Captain America: Brave New World,” all eyes will be on the staying power — industry parlance for how a movie’s ticket sales hold (or don’t) in the subsequent weekends on the big screen.

Popular on Variety

That’s of paramount concern because the all-powerful MCU has struggled with commercial consistency since the epic success of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” and these superhero sequels don’t come cheap. “Captain America: Brave New World” cost north of $180 million to make and at least $100 million to market across the globe. And it’s just one of three Marvel movies this year with “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” to follow in the summer.

“When you look at the release calendar, I don’t see anything that can cut into ‘Captain America,'” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “If audiences want to be entertained at a blockbuster level, it’s their only option.”

Indeed, there’s nothing resembling a four-quadrant blockbuster on the calendar until Disney’s “Snow White” remake on March 21. So cinema operators need “Captain America: Brave New World” to endure on the scale of 2023’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” rather than “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Marvels” to be deemed a financial winner.

“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” powered to $118 million domestically at the start of that summer’s movie season and continued to draw audiences in the following weekends, with revenues declining by 47% in its second and third outing and 35% in its fourth frame. Those were decent holds compared to other superhero films of its size. The third “Guardians” ended its run with $358 million in North America and a sizable $845 million globally. That’s the best case scenario for Cap’s latest cinematic adventure.

Yet the reality is that even Marvel’s biggest blockbusters have plunged after record-breaking debuts in the post-“Endgame” era. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and “Thor: Love and Thunder,” which earned $955 million and $760 million respectively in 2022, each declined 67% in their sophomore outings.

Then there’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania,” which scored a trilogy-best $120 million debut over Presidents Day weekend in 2023. Saddled with some of the worst reviews of any MCU film, ticket sales collapsed by 70% in its second weekend. The film ultimately failed to cross the $500 million mark worldwide, a modest benchmark for Marvel. Not to be outdone, “The Marvels,” the sole MCU movie to flop out of the gate, took a 78% nosedive in its second weekend.

“This has a chance to have long playability. ‘Ant-Man’ didn’t have that,” says Bock, referring to sleeper hits like “Cocaine Bear” and “Jesus Revolution,” both of which opened the weekend after “Quantumania.”

For “Captain America: Brave New World,” reviews and audience reactions aren’t exactly encouraging for the film’s theatrical endurance. The movie has dismal marks, at least by MCU standards, with a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and lousy “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls.

However there are signs, beyond a lack of competition, that Cap and company could withstand the bad buzz and give the box office a needed boost. The film boasted a strong turnout across all demographics; 35% of opening weekend ticket buyers were Caucasian, 26% were Latino and Hispanic, 23% were Black and 10% were Asian. It’s a sign the tentpole has the kind of broad appeal that’s necessary to boost a given movie from mere hit to runaway (Hulk) smash.

Moreover, sources close to the superhero adaptation believe that CinemaScore isn’t the best measure of moviegoer reception. They feel that way because those grades are bestowed after polling patrons in just a few theaters. On Rotten Tomatoes, a more expansive metric, “Captain America: Brave New World” has a stronger 80% “verified audience score.” (“Quantumania” has an 81% “verified audience score.”) PostTrak, another metric to poll moviegoers, reported that parents and kids gave the film four out of five stars. However, general audiences handed out three of five stars.

“Captain America: Brave New World” was also popular in premium formats with Imax, Dolby and other like formats accounting for 44% of inaugural sales. Those tickets are more expensive than standard 2D screens and have helped to offset a downward trend in attendance.

“We’re very happy on our side,” says Chris Randleman of Texas-based luxury movie theater chain Flix Brewhouse. “Walk-up business has been great despite the reviews. It’s an accessible film with a clear hook.”

He adds, “It’s going to look like ticket sales had a big drop. But that’s because this weekend is inflated with the double holiday of Valentine’s Day and Presidents Day.”

VIP+ Analysis: ‘Captain America’ Sequel Anything but Brave New Era for Aging Marvel IP

After the embarrassing misfires of “Ant-Man” and “The Marvels,” Disney’s CEO Bob Iger announced a company-wide mandate to focus on quality over quantity. “At the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,” Iger said during a 2023 earnings call. “We lost some focus.”

That year, in addition to the three theatrical releases, there were three Disney+ television series. Then, 2024 marked an aberration with just one film (along with another three seasons of television) on the calendar. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” an R-rated buddy comedy led by two of the most popular comic book characters, became an unmitigated smash with $1.33 billion globally.

Marvel is back to regularly scheduled programming with another two tentpoles on schedule over the next six months: “Thunderbolts” on May 2 and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” on July 25. Amid those megawatt titles, DC Comics has “Superman,” a Man of Steel reboot from director James Gunn, on July 11. Hollywood is banking on this year’s quartet of comic book offerings to revive the hit-or-miss superhero genre.

“The industry needs Marvel. No other film is opening to over $100 million in February,” says Bock. “Having three of them on the calendar is a bright spot.”"
'SNL50' didn't do justice to the past 50 years of comedy: Review - USA TODAY,"""Saturday Night Live"" cast past and present tried their best to make a 50th anniversary special, but failed to make it as good as regular ""SNL.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/02/17/snl-50-anniversary-special-review/78908273007/,entertainment,"Fifty years of ""Saturday Night Live"" is a lot of history, legacy and pressure to pack into a one-night special, even if it's 3½ hours long.

But producer Lorne Michaels and the ""SNL"" cast and writers, past and present, tried to do just that in the show's 50th anniversary special Sunday on NBC, a star-studded black-tie bacchanalia of celebrity cameos, sketch revivals and self-congratulatory montages that gave it the flavor of an awards show crossed with an extended episode of ""SNL"" crossed with a drunken party that should have been attended only by people who have actually worked on the show. The special even featured an ""In Memoriam"" segment, although it was reserved for all the offensive and poorly aged sketches over the years (and to remind us they re-aired a lot of the racist and sexist stuff).

It was a tonnage of effort and personality smushed onto the Studio 8H stage, and it all added up to something that was, well, fine? You could call it serviceable, checking nostalgia boxes while trying desperately to remain relevant to the youth of today, with more screen time for Sabrina Carpenter than Bill Murray. It had almost all the still-living heavy hitters from the series' history doing chuckle-worthy monologues and sketches. It was humorous, if not hilarious. And if we hadn't seen a similar but far better version of this a decade ago when the show celebrated its 40th anniversary, it might have been more satisfactory.

Maybe producers didn't want to repeat the classic sketches used in 2015, leaving the 50th stuck with the also-rans and ones that are less than a year old. The only advantage ""SNL50"" had over ""SNL40"" is that this time, Eddie Murphy actually appeared in sketches. But overall, it was a wasted opportunity to do something slightly different and far more transcendent.

The night started sleepily, and it was difficult to build energy. Opening with Carpenter, the hot pop star of the moment, and Paul Simon, an ""SNL"" staple since the show's second episode and a close friend of Michaels', was clearly an effort to marry the past and present, young and old. But the choice of ballad ""Homeward Bound"" made the cold open somber and slow. A monologue from consummate host Steve Martin brought a little bit of verve (especially his ""Gulf of America"" joke), but the momentum careened to a halt with a reprisal of Kristen Wiig's tiny-handed Dooneese sketch that went on far too long and for some reason included Kim Kardashian.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The rest of the evening veered from adequate to mediocre, with a flash or two of genuine brilliance. Murphy put his whole heart and soul into a Tracy Morgan impression for the ""Black Jeopardy!"" sketch that was, honest to goodness, the best thing the 63-year-old comedian and movie star has done in a decade. Mike Myers' classic ""Coffee Talk"" character Linda Richman joined Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler for ""Bronx Beat,"" a crossover that was smooth as buttah. But that was all alongside another edition of this season's already overplayed ""Domingo"" sketch, Murphy in a cringeworthy ""Scared Straight"" bit, and Kate McKinnon's usually hilarious alien abductee, who was upstaged by a fuzzy Meryl Streep cameo.

Nearly every sketch could have used the ruthless red pen of an editor as it dragged on to fill time. Most also felt as if they were only 80% finished. A New York history-themed installment of John Mulaney's trademark musical parodies featured some good moments, but it also felt as if it had no point. Plus we got another one of these back in November, the last time Mulaney hosted. Did we really need another one so soon?'

It's such a shame, because ""SNL40"" felt so essential to any fan of the series because the sketches were both familiar and novel: a ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"" that honored Will Ferrell and Norm Macdonald but left room for current cast member McKinnon to shine. A digital short from Andy Samberg and Adam Sandler making fun of cast members who ""break"" and giggle during a sketch. They were sketches that felt as if they could happen only on an anniversary show, and not just because of all the cameos; it's because they truly honored the show's legacy past and present. ""SNL50"" merely managed a handful of unsuccessful attempts to mesh what the show was with what it is now. But by the time Paul McCartney closed out the show, it felt as if we had all taken a dose of the ""After Update"" sleeping pill Alec Baldwin joked about in his short appearance.

A half-century in, ""SNL"" is something too big to be contained, let alone distilled into something succinct and sensational. Any version of a 50th anniversary special would likely disappoint in some way; there's just too much history here to get in everything everyone wants to see. But the version of the special Michaels and the writers created didn't have the sparkle of the show at its height.

It's nostalgic to watch the re-creations of the ""SNL"" of the past, but maybe we're better off just rewatching the sketches that made the show a cultural landmark in the first place."
70-Million-Year-Old Dinosaur Embryo Discovered In Fossilized Egg - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel,"Buried for 70 million years, a fossilized egg has revealed a stunning secret—a perfectly preserved dinosaur embryo unlike anything seen before.

The find is one of the most well-preserved dinosaur embryos ever uncovered, offering scientists a rare glimpse into the development and hatching behavior of prehistoric creatures.



The fossil, found in Missouri, sheds light on the evolutionary connection between dinosaurs and modern birds, revealing striking similarities in embryonic development.

A Prehistoric Time Capsule: The Discovery Of The Embryo

Fossilized dinosaur eggs are extremely rare, and finding one with an intact embryo is even more exceptional. This discovery provides an unparalleled look at dinosaur development, allowing paleontologists to study its structure, positioning, and potential behaviors.

The embryo, which was still in its egg when fossilization occurred, offers insights into how some dinosaurs may have prepared for hatching. Its curled posture resembles that of modern bird embryos, a similarity that has sparked further discussions about how much dinosaurs and birds have in common.

The fossil was discovered in Missouri, an area not typically associated with significant dinosaur finds. The region was once part of a prehistoric coastline, which suggests that the egg may have been buried in sediment, preserving it for millions of years.

The Mystery Of Why It Never Hatched

One of the biggest questions surrounding this discovery is why the dinosaur never hatched. Scientists speculate that environmental factors, predation, or even natural deformities may have contributed to the embryo remaining trapped inside the egg for eternity.

Fossilized eggs are already rare, but finding one with a well-preserved embryo is even more exceptional. The specimen provides a snapshot of prehistoric life frozen in time.

What This Means For Dinosaur Evolution?

The position of the embryo inside the egg mirrors a behavior seen in modern bird embryos, known as tucking, where the head is positioned under the wing to help with a successful hatching process. This suggests that dinosaurs may have exhibited bird-like behaviors even before birth, further solidifying their evolutionary connection.

Researchers hope that further analysis of this fossilized embryo will help answer lingering questions about dinosaur reproduction and growth. Could other dinosaur species have shown similar bird-like tendencies?



This find is yet another piece of the puzzle linking the ancient world to our present-day feathered friends.

A Rare Window Into Prehistoric Life

This discovery also highlights the importance of continued paleontological research. As excavation techniques improve and more fossils are uncovered, scientists are likely to make even more groundbreaking discoveries about dinosaur life.

While this dinosaur never hatched, its fossilized remains have given the scientific community a rare and invaluable glimpse into prehistoric life. The study of this embryo will continue to inform research on dinosaur reproduction, growth, and their transition into birds."
AI Finds Shared Neural Patterns Across Minds - Neuroscience News,Researchers have developed a geometric deep learning approach to uncover shared brain activity patterns across individuals.,https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-neural-patterns-shared-28429/,science,"Summary: Researchers have developed a geometric deep learning approach to uncover shared brain activity patterns across individuals.

Tested on macaques and rats, MARBLE accurately decoded neural activity linked to movement and navigation, outperforming other machine learning methods. The system works by mapping neural data into high-dimensional geometric spaces, enabling pattern recognition across individuals and conditions.

In the parable of the blind men and the elephant, several blind men each describe a different part of an elephant they are touching – a sharp tusk, a flexible trunk, or a broad leg – and disagree about the animal’s true nature.

The story illustrates the problem of understanding an unseen, or latent object based on incomplete individual perceptions.

Likewise, when researchers study brain dynamics based on recordings of a limited number of neurons, they must infer the latent patterns of brain dynamics that generate these recordings.

This gives it an edge over other methods, which must work with a user-defined global shape. Credit: Neuroscience News

“Suppose you and I both engage in a mental task, such as navigating our way to work. Can signals from a small fraction of neurons tell us that we use the same or different mental strategies to solve the task?” says Pierre Vandergheynst, head of the Signal Processing Laboratory LTS2 in EPFL’s School of Engineering.

“This is a fundamental question to neuroscience, because experimentalists often record data from many animals, yet we have limited evidence as to whether they represent a given task using the same brain patterns.”

Vandergheynst and former postdoc Adam Gosztolai, now an assistant professor at the AI Institute of the Medical University of Vienna, have published a geometric deep learning approach in Nature Methods that can infer latent brain activity patterns across experimental subjects.

MARBLE (Manifold Representation Basis Learning) achieves this by breaking down electrical neural activity into dynamic patterns, or motifs, that are learnable by a geometric neural network.

In experiments on macaque and rat brain recordings, the scientists used MARBLE to show that when different animals used the same mental strategy to reach an arm or navigate a maze, their brain dynamics were made up of the same motifs.

A geometric neural net for dynamic data

Traditional deep learning is not suited to understanding dynamic systems that change regularly as a function of time, like firing neurons or flowing fluids.

These patterns of activity are so complex that they are best described as geometric objects in high-dimensional spaces. One example of such an object is a torus, which resembles a donut.

As Gosztolai explains, MARBLE is unique because it learns from within curved spaces –natural mathematical spaces for complex patterns of neuronal activity.

“Inside the curved spaces, the geometric deep learning algorithm is unaware that these spaces are curved. Thus, the dynamic motifs it learns are independent of the shape of the space, meaning it can discover the same motifs from different recordings.”

The EPFL team tested MARBLE on recordings of the pre-motor cortex of macaques during a reaching task, and of the hippocampus of rats during a spatial navigation task.

They found that MARBLE’s representations based on single-neuron population recordings were much more interpretable than those from other machine learning methods, and that MARBLE could decode brain activity to arm movements with greater accuracy than other methods.

Moreover, because MARBLE is grounded in the mathematic theory of high-dimensional shapes, it was able to independently patch together brain activity recordings from different experimental conditions into a global structure. This gives it an edge over other methods, which must work with a user-defined global shape.

Brain-machine interfaces and beyond

In addition to furthering our understanding of the dynamics underpinning brain computations and behavior, MARBLE could use neural activity data to recognize the brain’s dynamic patterns when carrying out specific tasks, like reaching, and transform them into decodable representations that could then be used to trigger an assistive robotic device.

However, the researchers emphasize that MARBLE is a powerful tool that could be applied across scientific fields and datasets to compare dynamic phenomena.

“The MARBLE method is primarily aimed at helping neuroscience researchers understand how the brain computes across individuals or experimental conditions, and to uncover – when they exist – universal patterns,” Vandergheynst says.

“But its mathematical basis is by no means limited to brain signals, and we expect that our tool will benefit researchers in other fields of life and physical sciences who wish to jointly analyze multiple datasets.”

“Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry” by Pierre Vandergheynst et al. Nature Methods

Abstract

Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry

The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations.

We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, which decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning.

In simulated nonlinear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrize high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making and changes in the internal state.

These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations.

Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared to current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input.

Our results suggest that a manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments."
"Europe Approves First ""Disabled Astronaut"" for Long-Term ISS Mission—a Historic Leap for Space - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel","Space just took a historic leap forward, but not everyone is on board. A former Paralympian is about to break barriers that once seemed impossible. Despite skepticism, ESA has given the green light for something never done before.",https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/europes-first-disabled-astronaut-approved-for-long-term-iss-missions/,science,"John McFall, the European Space Agency (ESA)’s first para-astronaut, has been medically cleared for a long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS), ESA’s Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, Daniel Neuenschwander, confirmed this Friday. The decision marks a major step in space exploration, proving that disability does not disqualify individuals from reaching for the stars.

A Groundbreaking Step for Inclusive Spaceflight

McFall, a 43-year-old British national, lost his right leg above the knee in a motorcycle accident at age 19. Despite this, he became a Paralympic sprinter and later a surgeon, before being selected in 2022 as ESA’s first astronaut with a disability. His journey represents a turning point, not just in space exploration, but in the way society views physical limitations.

The announcement comes after the conclusion of Fly!, an ESA-led feasibility study that examined the challenges and possibilities of a para-astronaut working in microgravity. The results were clear: there are no obstacles preventing McFall from participating in a full mission.

To earn his certification, McFall had to demonstrate his ability to complete every required astronaut task, including emergency procedures, microgravity adaptation, and daily station operations. His performance exceeded expectations.

Neuenschwander admitted he initially anticipated potential challenges, but was “surprised” at how seamlessly McFall adapted. “Let’s not underestimate all elements linked to safety procedures when you operate on the International Space Station,” he noted.

Prosthetic Technology and Space Adaptation

While medical clearance is a major milestone, McFall’s prosthetic leg must still undergo rigorous qualification for space travel. Any object taken aboard the ISS must meet strict safety and operational standards, and his prosthesis is no exception. ESA is working with the German orthopedic company Ottobock to adapt the design for use in microgravity.

McFall sees this process as an opportunity not just for himself, but for millions of prosthetic users worldwide. “What we do in space should also benefit people on Earth,” he said, emphasizing the potential advancements in prosthetic technology that could come from this mission.

To ensure that his prosthesis performs safely in space, McFall has engaged in intensive testing, including cycling in a head-down position to assess how microgravity affects the fit and comfort of his artificial limb. These tests are crucial for both his safety and efficiency aboard the ISS.

The Road to an Official Mission

Though ESA has given the green light, McFall’s mission is not yet scheduled. The next phase involves determining the scientific objectives he will focus on during his stay aboard the ISS. His presence could lead to unique research on human adaptation to space, with a focus on prosthetics, mobility, and rehabilitation in microgravity.

This milestone also highlights the diverging approaches to diversity and inclusion in space programs worldwide. While ESA continues to champion an inclusive future for human spaceflight, the new U.S. administration under Donald Trump has pushed back against DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) initiatives.

Neuenschwander acknowledged this shift, stating, “We are stepping into a slightly changing world, from a DEI perspective, than that of one of our partners on the ISS.”

A Symbol of Change

McFall’s journey is more than just a personal achievement—it represents a broader cultural shift in space exploration. As agencies push for greater accessibility, the dream of space travel is no longer limited to those who fit traditional astronaut molds.

With the final steps underway, the world may soon witness history: the first para-astronaut living and working in space for six months, proving that the limits of the past do not define the future."

Russian Scientists Unveil Plasma Rocket Engine Which Could Reach Mars in Only 30 Days — Game over for Starship? - Indian Defence Review,"Russian scientists have unveiled a groundbreaking plasma engine that could revolutionize space travel, potentially reducing the journey to Mars to just 30 days.

Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, this innovative propulsion system aims to revolutionize space travel, but how close is it to real-world deployment?

A Propulsion Breakthrough

Unlike traditional rockets that rely on chemical combustion, this magnetoplasma propulsion system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles, primarily hydrogen ions. The result is a continuous thrust that allows spacecraft to steadily accelerate, reaching speeds of 100 km/s (360,000 km/h). By contrast, conventional rockets max out at 4.5 km/s, making them far less efficient for long-duration space travel.

This sustained acceleration could make it possible for astronauts to reach Mars in just 30 to 60 days, significantly reducing their exposure to cosmic radiation and the psychological toll of long-haul space missions.

A Working Prototype in Testing

This breakthrough isn’t just theoretical—it’s already undergoing ground tests. Rosatom’s prototype is being tested inside a 4-meter-wide, 14-meter-long vacuum chamber, simulating the conditions of space. The engine operates at 300 kW in a pulse-periodic mode and has successfully demonstrated a lifespan of 2,400 hours—enough for a full journey to Mars.

Rather than replacing chemical rockets, this engine would activate once a spacecraft reaches orbit, providing efficient propulsion for deep-space missions. It could also serve as a space tug, drastically cutting travel time between planetary orbits for cargo and crewed missions.

Why Hydrogen Is the Key

One of the biggest advantages of this propulsion system is its use of hydrogen as the primary fuel. Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, making it an ideal choice for deep-space travel. Since it could potentially be harvested from space, this system could help spacecraft reduce reliance on Earth-based fuel supplies.

Another key benefit is hydrogen’s ability to enable high-speed ion acceleration, allowing the engine to operate more efficiently. Unlike other plasma propulsion methods that generate excessive heat, this system produces less thermal stress on components, improving its durability and long-term viability.

Benchmarking Against Existing Technologies

Plasma propulsion itself isn’t new, but Rosatom’s system significantly outperforms current designs. Most existing ion thrusters operate at speeds between 30 and 50 km/s, and this new engine claims to reach 100 km/s—a massive leap forward.

Russia has already proven its expertise in plasma propulsion. Some of NASA’s Psyche mission components and several OneWeb satellites rely on Russian-made plasma thrusters. If this new system performs as expected, it could put Russia decades ahead of competitors in the race for next-generation space propulsion.

When Could This Engine Be Space-Ready?

Rosatom’s development roadmap is ambitious, with a flight-ready model expected by 2030. This timeline might seem aggressive, but Russia’s long history of advancing space propulsion technology gives the project credibility.

If successful, this system could drastically improve deep-space missions, opening the door to faster Mars travel, asteroid exploration, and even missions to the outer solar system within a human lifetime.

Is It a Game-Changer or Just Hype?

The idea of a 30-day Mars journey is exciting, but some challenges remain. Independent verification of the engine’s performance is still needed, as no peer-reviewed studies have confirmed the full capabilities Rosatom claims. Another major hurdle is integration with spacecraft, as designing a mission architecture around this propulsion system will require significant engineering advancements.

Power generation is also a key issue. A nuclear reactor will likely be needed to supply the necessary energy for long-duration missions, which adds complexity and raises safety concerns.

Despite these uncertainties, Rosatom’s plasma engine represents a bold step forward. If it delivers on its promises, it could mark the beginning of a new era in space travel, bringing us closer than ever to a future of rapid interplanetary exploration."
New Theory Explains How Ancient Earth Came to Be So Wet - ScienceAlert,"When Earth first formed, it was too hot to retain ice.",https://www.sciencealert.com/new-theory-explains-how-ancient-earth-came-to-be-so-wet,science,"When Earth first formed, it was too hot to retain ice. This means all the water on our planet must have originated from extraterrestrial sources.

Studies of ancient terrestrial rocks suggest liquid water existed on Earth as early as 100 million years after the Sun's formation – practically 'immediately' on an astrophysical timescale.

This water, now over 4.5 billion years old, has been perpetually renewed through Earth's water cycle. My research team has recently proposed a new theory to explain how water first arrived on Earth.

A mystery billions of years in the making

Astrophysicists have been grappling with the question of how water arrived on our young planet for decades. One of the earliest hypotheses suggested that Earth's water was a direct byproduct of the planet's formation, released via magma during volcanic eruptions, in which most of the emitted gas is water vapor.

However, this hypothesis evolved in the 1990s following analysis of Earth's water composition and the discovery of the potential role of icy comets, pointing to an extraterrestrial origin.

Comets, which are mixtures of ice and rock formed in the distant reaches of the solar system, are sometimes ejected toward the Sun. When warmed by the Sun, they develop striking tails of dust and gas that are visible from Earth. Asteroids, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, were also proposed as potential progenitors of Earth's water.

The study of cometary and asteroid rocks via meteorites – small fragments of these bodies that have fallen to Earth – has provided key insights.

By analyzing the D/H ratio – the proportion of heavy hydrogen (deuterium) to standard hydrogen – scientists found that Earth's water more closely matches that of 'carbonaceous' asteroids, which bear traces of past water. This shifted the focus of research toward these asteroids.

Recent studies have centered on identifying the celestial mechanisms that could have delivered these water-rich asteroids to the dry surface of early Earth. Numerous theories have emerged to explain the 'perturbation' of planetesimals – large, icy bodies in the asteroid and Kuiper belts.

These scenarios propose gravitational interactions that dislodged these objects, sending them hurtling toward Earth. Such events would have required a complex 'gravitational billiards' process, suggesting a tumultuous history of the Solar System.

While it is evident that planetary formation involved significant upheavals and impacts, it is possible that Earth's water delivery occurred in a more natural and less dramatic manner.

A simpler hypothesis

I started with the assumption that asteroids emerge icy from their formation cocoon, also known as the protoplanetary disk. This cocoon is a massive, hydrogen-rich disk filled with dust, where planets and initial belts form. It envelops the entire nascent planetary system.

Once this protective cocoon dissipates – after a few million years – the asteroids warm up, causing their ice to melt or, more precisely, to sublimate. In space, where pressure is nearly zero, the water remains in vapor form after this process.

A disk of water vapour is then superimposed on the asteroid belt orbiting the Sun. As the ice sublimates, the disk fills with vapor, which spreads inward toward the Sun due to complex dynamic processes. Along the way, this vapor disk encounters the inner planets, immersing them in a kind of 'bath'.

In a way, the disk 'waters' the terrestrial planets: Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury. Most of this water capture occurred 20 to 30 million years after the Sun's formation, during a period when the Sun's luminosity increased dramatically over a brief period of time, increasing the degassing rate of asteroids.

Step-by-step illustration of a new model for water distribution on the inner planets of the solar system, including Earth. Five million years after the Sun's birth, asteroids in the main belt release water vapor due to solar energy. This vapor gradually spreads into the inner solar system, eventually enveloping the planets, which capture part of it to form oceans between 10 and 100 million years later. (Sylvain Cnudde/Observatoire de Paris – PSL/LESIA, Fourni par l'auteur)

Once water is captured by a planet's gravitational pull, many processes can occur.

On Earth, however, a protective mechanism ensures the total mass of water has remained relatively constant from the end of the capture period until today. If water rises too high into the atmosphere, it condenses into clouds, which eventually return to the surface as rain–a process known as the water cycle.

The quantities of water on Earth, both past and present, are well documented. Our model, which begins with the degassing of ice from the original asteroid belt, successfully accounts for the amount of water needed to form oceans, rivers and lakes, and even the water buried deep within Earth's mantle.

Precise measurements of the D/H ratio of water in the oceans also align with our model. Moreover, the model explains the quantities of water present in the past on other planets–and even on the Moon.

You might wonder how I arrived at this new theory. It stems from recent observations, particularly those made with ALMA, a radio telescope array of over 60 antennae located in Chile, on a plateau five kilometres above sea level.

Observations of extrasolar systems with belts similar to the Kuiper Belt reveal that planetesimals in these belts sublimate carbon monoxide (CO). For belts closer to their star, such as the asteroid belt, CO is too volatile to be present, and water is more likely to be released.

Building the model

It was from these findings that the initial idea for the theory began to take shape. Moreover, recent data from the Hayabusa 2 and OSIRIS-REx missions, which explored asteroids similar to those that might have contributed to the formation of the initial water vapor disk, provided key confirmation.

These missions, along with long-standing observations from ground-based telescopes, revealed substantial amounts of hydrated minerals on these asteroids–minerals that can only form through contact with water. This supports the premise that these asteroids were initially icy, even though most have since lost their ice (except for larger bodies like Ceres).

With the foundation of the model in place, the next step was to develop a numerical simulation to track the degassing of ice, the dispersion of water vapor, and its eventual capture by planets.

During these simulations, it quickly became clear that the model could account for Earth's water supply. Additional research on past water quantities for Mars and other terrestrial planets confirmed the model's applicability to them as well. It all fit, and the results were ready for publication!

As researchers, it's not enough to design a model that works and seems to explain everything. The theory must be tested on a larger scale. While it's now impossible to detect the initial water vapor disk that 'watered' the terrestrial planets, we can look to extrasolar systems with young asteroid belts to see if such water vapor disks exist.

According to our calculations, these disks, though faint, should be detectable with ALMA. Our team has just secured time on ALMA to investigate specific systems for evidence of them.

We may be at the dawn of a new era in understanding the origins of Earth's water.

3D-printed 'hydrogels' could be future space radiation shields for astronaut trips to Mars - Space.com,Those tiny colorful dinosaur toys that grow bigger underwater might hold the key to protecting astronauts as they journey through space.,https://www.space.com/space-exploration/tech/3d-printed-hydrogels-could-be-future-space-radiation-shields-for-astronaut-trips-to-mars,science,"Spend a single day outside our planet's protective atmosphere and magnetic field , and you could be exposed to radiation levels equivalent to what you'd experience across a whole year back on Earth .

It's a risk astronauts face, and especially so during long trips. As such, finding methods to combat radiation exposure in space has long been on the minds of researchers working on technology for space travel.

New research suggests a novel solution: a material called ""hydrogel"" — the same technology used for the 'grow monster' toys — could shield space travelers from harmful radiation.

A research team from the Polymer Chemistry and Biomaterials Group at Ghent University in Belgium have been testing this type of superabsorbent polymer as an alternative radiation shield.

""The superabsorbent polymer that we are using can be processed using multiple different techniques, which is a rare and advantageous quality amongst polymers,"" Manon Minsart, a postdoctoral assistant at Ghent Universaid, said in a statement. ""Our method of choice is 3D printing , which allows us to create a hydrogel in almost any shape we want.""

Hydrogels of course are already used in a range of consumer products. ""The beauty of this project is that we are working with a well-known technology,"" Ghent researcher Lenny Van Daele said, in the same statement. ""Hydrogels are found in many things we use every day, from contact lenses to diapers and sanitary products.""

While water can create a good shield for radiation, according to the researchers, SAPs could be even safer and more effective. Rather than using free-flowing water as radiation protection, hydrogel soaks up the water, creating equal distribution and protection — and if the protective layer is punctured, the water won't leak out, which is important when working around sensitive electronics.

In addition to protecting astronauts, the European Space Agency (ESA) foresees further uses for hydrogel in space. ""The material could also potentially be applied to uncrewed missions — in radiation shields for spacecraft, or as water reservoirs once we have optimised the method of retrieving water from the hydrogel,"" added Malgorzata Holynska of ESA's Materials, Environments and Contamination Control Section, in the statement.

This new study builds on previous work where hydrogel was tested to make sure that it was safe to use in space conditions. ""There is a constant search for lightweight radiation protection materials,"" project lead Peter Dubruel said, in the statement. ""We are applying different techniques to shape the material into a 3D structure and scale up the production process, so that we can come a step closer to industrialisation."""
Researchers link a gene to the emergence of spoken language - The Associated Press,Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role.

Researchers at Rockefell…,https://apnews.com/article/speech-genetics-humans-neanderthals-2e1f956c9c794706000162072f0c0c41,science,"Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role – and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.

A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.

The new study is “a good first step to start looking at the specific genes” that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.

What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.

AP AUDIO: Researchers link a gene to the emergence of spoken language Scientists say they’ve linked one particular gene to the ability to speak in humans. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes “that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today” said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.

Darnell has been studying the protein – called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development – since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York’s Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.

Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.

Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, “and they spoke differently” with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.

This isn’t the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.

Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn’t unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.

The presence of a gene variant isn’t the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.

Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.

University of Minnesota’s Finestack said it’s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.

“That’s certainly a possibility,” she said.

James Webb Space Telescope learns how a cosmic phoenix cools off to birth stars - Space.com,"""The Phoenix cluster has the largest reservoir of hot, cooling gas of any galaxy cluster.""",https://www.space.com/jwst-pheonix-cluster-star-birth,science,"An image of the Phoenix cluster constructed with observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Very Large Array radio telescope.

How do you cool down a phoenix? I don't mean the mythological birds of flame and rebirth, but rather a cosmic namesake with a fittingly fiery nature.

Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers may finally have the answer. They used the powerful instrument to investigate the extreme cooling of gas in the Phoenix cluster, a grouping of galaxies bound by gravity located around 5.8 billion light-years from Earth.



Stars can only form when gas is cool enough to clump together in overly dense patches, which is why scientists are particularly interested in how the Phoenix cluster forms stars. Indeed, this section of the universe forms stars at an incredible rate.

That incredible rate persists despite the fact that at the heart of the Phoenix cluster is a supermassive black hole 10 billion times as massive as the sun. This monster black hole is acting as a natural particle accelerator driving away gas and keeping it hot — according to theory, this should be curtailing star formation.

This seeming contradiction has led to the Phoenix cluster becoming an object of mystery.

The new JWST investigation might finally put an end to the confusion, however, building upon a decade of previous studies conducted using the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and a wealth of ground-based observatories.



""We can compare our previous studies of the Phoenix cluster, which found differing cooling rates at different temperatures, to a ski slope,"" said Michael McDonald of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and principal investigator of the program, in a statement. ""The Phoenix cluster has the largest reservoir of hot, cooling gas of any galaxy cluster — analogous to having the busiest chair lift, bringing the most skiers to the top of the mountain. However, not all of those skiers were making it down the mountain, meaning not all the gas was cooling to low temperatures.



""If you had a ski slope where there were significantly more people getting off the ski lift at the top than were arriving at the bottom, that would be a problem!""

This team thinks the JWST has finally located these ""missing skiers"" trapped midway down the Phoenix Cluster temperature ""mountain.""

The 'missing skiers' on the Phoenix Cluster slope

Using the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), the team collected 2D spectroscopic data from the region of the sky containing the Phoenix Cluster, thereby studying this galaxy grouping's core in unprecedented detail.

This helped the researchers locate the ""missing"" cooling gas that contributes to star formation. They also found that this gas, with a temperature of around 540,000 degrees Fahrenheit (300,000 degrees Celsius), was located within cavities in the Phoenix Cluster.

Spectroscopic data collected from the JWST overlayed on an image of the Phoenix cluster that combines data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope. The JWST detected the cooling gas that leads to a furious rate of star formation in this massive galaxy cluster. (Image credit: NASA, CXC, NRAO, ESA, M. McDonald (MIT), M. Reefe (MIT), J. Olmsted (STScI))

These cavities trace both the incredibly hot gas, with temperatures of 18 million degrees Fahrenheit (10 million degrees Celsius), and the cooled gas, which is 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius).

""Previous studies only measured gas at the extreme cold and hot ends of the temperature distribution throughout the center of the cluster,"" said McDonald. ""We were limited — it was not possible to detect the 'warm' gas that we were looking for. With the JWST, we could do this for the first time.""

The sensitivity of MIRI got a boost in this investigation from a natural phenomenon in the Phoenix Cluster that sees neon and oxygen atoms being ionized, or stripped of electrons, in similar environments.



Though ionized oxygen is much brighter, it is only visible in ultraviolet wavelengths of light. Neon, though dimmer, emits infrared light, which the JWST has been built to see.



""In the mid-infrared wavelengths detected by the JWST, the neon VI signature was absolutely booming,"" team leader and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Michael Reefe said in the statement. ""Even though this emission is usually more difficult to detect, the JWST's sensitivity in the mid-infrared cuts through all of the noise.”

Though the Phoenix Cluster is a unique conglomeration of galaxies in terms of many of its characteristics, the team now aims to use this ""proof of concept"" technique and the sensitivity of MIRI to study other galaxy clusters as well.

The team's research was published on Feb. 5 in the journal Nature."

Quantum Search For Time's Source Finds No Difference Between Past And Future - ScienceAlert,"No matter how hard we try, we can't remember tomorrow.",https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-search-for-times-source-finds-no-difference-between-past-and-future,science,"No matter how hard we try, we can't remember tomorrow. And physicists have no idea why.

In hope of discovering the source of time's river, University of Surrey physicists Thomas Guff, Chintalpati Umashankar Shastry, and Andrea Rocco looked for signs of its existence in the equivalent of a hot quantum bathtub beneath the infinite expanse of eternity.

Needless to say they didn't find what they were looking for, instead confirming time flows backward just as easily as it does forward in the buzz of quantum mechanics. Yet the lessons learned could someday reveal why physics insists on the existence of history.

To use the correct jargon, physics is by and large symmetrical when it comes to time. We might never see an egg uncrack or an oak revert to an acorn, but when most processes are stripped down to their fundamental laws, there's little dictating which end of an equation must face the past and which the future.

It's not like there's a shortage of places to hunt for clues on why the past is locked in place. Cosmologists have looked at how the Universe expands from a low-to-high entropy state, for example. Quantum physicists have wondered whether the ever-widening net of a particle's entanglement with the environment might be involved. Until now, nothing has stood out as a clear explanation for why the dimension of time has such cohesion.

Guff, Shastry, and Rocco wondered if quantum equations of motion might yet hide a means of making a return to a past state impossible, acting as a kind of ratchet that ensures a system's laws don't slip backward.

They used a mathematical approximation known as a Markov chain to describe a simplified model of heated particles jostling in an open container. Applying Markovian dynamics, in which the system has no memory beyond the present, each new quantum state within the system would depend on just a single previous state, which could mean a one-way trip to tomorrow-land or an oscillation that just as easily takes particles backward.

No matter where the team looked in their bath's equations, they could find no signs that time-reversal symmetry was at odds with how quantum activity unfolded, implying the 'memory' of the Markovian system held no preference for a past or future.

""Our findings suggest that while our common experience tells us that time only moves one way, we are just unaware that the opposite direction would have been equally possible,"" says Rocco.

If time can jiggle back and forth on a quantum level, it certainly doesn't on the scale of physics we experience. An actual hot bath out beneath the stars is guaranteed to cool quickly as energy flows out into the ever-expanding cosmos.

The trio insist their findings don't contradict this law of thermodynamics in any way. Some laws of physics are truly irreversible, after all. Yet flipping the arrow of time on a quantum scale would still have seen a steady cooling occur, suggesting there's nothing overly special about one direction over the other on a quantum scale when it comes to thermodynamics.

If so, our collective experience of time's one-way street just might be balanced on the other side of the Big Bang by a second avenue, one that is also carried away by cosmic expansion and increasing energy from a quantum starting point that remembers the future as easily as it does the past.

30-Million-Year-Old Hypercarnivore Skull 'Dream Find' For Paleontologists - ScienceAlert,"In Fayum, Egypt, where now lies a barren desert, a lush forest once stood, teeming with life.",https://www.sciencealert.com/30-million-year-old-hypercarnivore-skull-dream-find-for-paleontologists,science,"In Fayum, Egypt, where now lies a barren desert, a lush forest once stood, teeming with life.

Paradise for all creatures therein, however, it was not. The primates, hippopotamuses, elephants, and hyraxes that lived there 30 million years ago were all likely prey for one fearsome hunter: a leopard-sized apex predator with crushing jaws and razor-sharp teeth.

We know this because paleontologists have just made a startling find: a nearly complete skull from this newly discovered hypercarnivore. It belonged to a member of the extinct order of carnivores known as Hyaenodonta.

A team led by paleontologist Shorouq Al-Ashqar of Mansoura University and the American University in Egypt has given the fearsome creature the name Bastetodon syrtos, after the Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of protection, Bastet.

""For days, the team meticulously excavated layers of rock dating back around 30 million years,"" Al-Ashqar recalls of the dig that yielded the fossilized skull bones.

""Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable – a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground. His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist.""

The Fayum Depression, where the bones were found, represents an incredibly rich and important fossil assemblage for understanding a 15 million-year period in the history of the region, during the Paleogene, a crucial time in the rise of mammals.

Paleontologists have been working in the region for more than a century, uncovering the rich ecosystem that once thrived there.

""The Fayum is one of the most important fossil areas in Africa,"" explains paleontologist Matt Borths of Duke University in the US. ""Without it, we would know very little about the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals like elephants, primates, and hyaenodonts.""

Although all bones are important for understanding the anatomy of extinct beasts, the skull is arguably the most important, revealing much about an animal's survival strategies. The skull of Bastetodon reveals dentition consistent with Hyaeonodonta, allowing its confident classification, as well as insights into its lifestyle.

The animal, the researchers say, was a hypercarnivore – one whose diet, much like cats (wild ones, at any rate) and crocodiles, consists of more than 70 percent meat. It would have occupied a top predator position in its local food web.

But the discovery allowed something else – the contextualization of fossils discovered 120 years ago. These remains belonged to a group of lion-sized hyaenodonts that lived in the Fayum region millions of years ago. When they were first analyzed in 1904, they were lumped in with European hyaenodonts.

Al-Ashqar and her colleagues found that these fossils, newly grouped together under the genus Sekhmetops (for the Ancient Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of war, Sekhmet) originated in Africa in waves, and are distinct from the European hyaenodonts. Bastetodon also originated in Africa.

From there, the animals spread across the Northern hemisphere, making their way to Asia, Europe, India, and North America. However, their reign in Africa was curtailed by environmental changes that led to their eventual extinction, opening ecological niches for other predators to rise to prominence.

""The discovery of Bastetodon is a significant achievement in understanding the diversity and evolution of hyaenodonts and their global distribution,"" Al-Ashqar says. ""We are eager to continue our research to unravel the intricate relationships between these ancient predators and their environments over time and across continents.""

The research has been published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology."
New experiments finally prove a long-forgotten theory about how quantum particles spin - The Conversation,Scientists thought there was no way to verify the ‘quantumness’ of the enigmatic ‘spin’ just by watching it rotate – until now.,https://theconversation.com/new-experiments-finally-prove-a-long-forgotten-theory-about-how-quantum-particles-spin-250059,science,"What makes something quantum? This question has kept a small but dedicated fraction of the world’s population – most of them quantum physicists – up at night for decades.

At very small scales, we know the universe is made up of waves and energy fields ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics, but at the scale of the everyday world around us we mostly see solid objects following the older rules of classical mechanics. When we ask what makes something quantum, we are asking where the line is between these two realms and how it can be drawn.

In a new study published in Newton, we answer this question in a previously undiscovered way. We show that a single spinning particle can show indubitable evidence of quantum behaviour.

The discovery of spin

One hundred years ago, Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck proposed the idea that most tiny particles never really stand still. Instead, they suggested, electrons – elementary particles that form the outer shell of atoms – behave like minuscule spinning tops.

The spin can be either clockwise or anticlockwise, or what physicists call “spin up” and “spin down”. This binary nature of spinning electrons means that they can be used as building blocks for quantum computers.

However, in 1925 Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck’s spinning electron proposal caused an uproar in the physics establishment. At this time, physics was shaped by illustrious names such as Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Paul Ehrenfest, who laid the groundwork for the grand theories of relativity and quantum mechanics that transformed our understanding of the universe.

After eminent physicist and Nobel laureate Hendrik Lorentz criticised the spin theory, Uhlenbeck got cold feet and wanted to retract the paper. Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit’s mentor Ehrenfest told them to persist, writing: “You are both young enough to be able to afford a stupidity!”

Old ideas still remain

This kind of resistance to new ideas is not unusual in physics. As Planck put it, science progresses one funeral at a time.

Much like the scepticism about the discovery of spinning electrons, today many physicists are educated with a misconception about how spin works. Conventional wisdom, still taught in standard textbooks, tells us that spin is a quantum property that is essential to understanding the behaviour of electrons and nuclei. But at the same time, the textbooks say the rotation of the particle is still somehow perfectly described by classical physics.

Tsirelson’s forgotten protocol

A similar consideration applies to another textbook system, the harmonic oscillator (e.g. a pendulum). According to a 1927 theorem by Paul Ehrenfest, the way a quantum pendulum swings is indistinguishable from a swing in the park.

Strikingly, almost 80 years later the Russian-Israeli physicist Boris Tsirelson had an idea showing that it is possible to discern a quantum pendulum from a swing in the park, provided the quantum system is prepared in a truly quantum state. At the time, Tsirelson’s paper attracted little notice.

Another 15 years later, the research team of Valerio Scarani in Singapore resurfaced Tsirelson’s paper from the depths of the internet. Scarani’s student Zaw Lin Htoo extended Tsirelson’s idea, proving theoretically that it actually was possible to detect quantumness in the rotation of a spin.

Bigger particles and Schrödinger’s cat

Our team at the University of New South Wales decided to take on the challenge and prove the quantumness of a spin in a real experiment. However, we couldn’t do it with a simple spin like an electron. Because an electron is so small, it only has two possible spin states: up and down. Again defying widespread intuition, it turns out that an electron spin can only be prepared in quasi-classical states, which obey the old textbook predictions.

Instead we used a much larger particle, the nucleus of an antimony atom. The spin of this particle can point in eight different directions, instead of just two.

We were able to place the atom in a so-called “Schrödinger’s cat” state, in which it is in a superposition of two widely different spin directions at once.

We then performed the Tsirelson-Scarani protocol, which involves measuring not just the average orientation of the spin, but the positivity of it – a very different kind of measurement to what is done in standard spin resonance setups. This experiment showed unquestionable evidence for the quantumness of the antimony’s spin.

What’s next?

Our study is important for discovering fundamental truths about the universe, and for providing clarity on what it means to “be quantum”. However, it may also have real-life applications.

The states that we demonstrated to be quantum with the Tsirelson-Scarani protocol are exactly the kind of thing that give quantum computation and quantum sensing an advantage over classical counterparts. In the future we will focus making the most of these systems for use in technological applications."

Amazing Fossil Reveals Turtle-Like Scales on Jurassic Plesiosaur - ScienceAlert,"Serpentine-necked, four-flippered plesiosaurs were among the most successful marine predators in the time of dinosaurs.",https://www.sciencealert.com/amazing-fossil-reveals-turtle-like-scales-on-jurassic-plesiosaur,science,"Serpentine-necked, four-flippered plesiosaurs were among the most successful marine predators in the time of dinosaurs.

A remarkably complete and well-preserved fossil has revealed that at least some of these mighty hunters had flipper scales similar to today's sea turtles, which may have aided in either swimming or dragging themselves along the seafloor.

While plesiosaur fossils have been found worldwide, only about eight samples of their soft tissues have been recorded so far.

Lund University paleontologist Miguel Marx and colleagues' new analysis uses microscopy and spectroscopy to provide never-before-known details of what these animals looked like.

These fossilized bones belonged to a roughly 4.5-meter-long plesiosaur that swam Earth's oceans 183 million years ago, during the Jurassic, when plesiosaurs were especially common, the team confirmed.

Designated MH 7, they were excavated from Holzmaden in Germany back in 1940, then spent some time buried in a museum garden for protection during WWII, followed by long-term storage.

frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen>

Plesiosaurs bore live babies and breathed air, traits that suggest they may have been warm-blooded. And while the skin from this fossil's tail was smooth like today's warm-blooded marine animals, a sample from the right fore flipper revealed small irregular triangular structures.

The researchers compared the fossilized skin samples to animals still living today.

""[The flippers] clearly differ from the soft, scale-less skin occurring around the tail of MH 7 and instead compare closely with carapace scutes of fossil and living turtles, as well as mosasauroid marine lizard scales,"" they write in their paper.

As well as the scales, the thickness of their skin was also comparable to living sea turtles.

These anatomical features may have evolutionarily converged towards similar shapes thanks to shared hydrodynamic pressures, the team suspects, or to help provide traction on the seafloor substrate.

""Another purpose of the flipper scales in MH 7 may have been to provide a protective covering for traction on the seafloor during benthic grazing,"" add the researchers.

""This is consistent with plesiosaur 'bottom-walking' and feeding traces as well as preserved gastric contents which comprise coarse sediment masses.""

Several species have been found with fossilized gut contents full of bottom-dwelling snails and crustaceans.

Pigment cells were also found close to the outer surface of MH 7's tail skin, but not on the surface of the flipper, which is much tougher.

""These cells are characterized by corneous beta-proteins that make living reptile scales hard and immobile,"" Marx and team explain.

So it seems plesiosaurs retained their reptilian scales after transitioning from land into their marine form, unlike other marine reptiles at the time, such as the more fish-shaped ichthyosaurs, that instead lost their scales to reduce drag in water.

The scales ""along the trailing edges of the flippers undoubtedly fulfilled some functional role and presumably conferred a selective advantage for plesiosaurs during their protracted evolution as one of the most successful pelagic tetrapod clades,"" the researchers conclude.

"Most Birds-of-Paradise Are Secretly Biofluorescent, Study Finds - ScienceAlert","Birds-of-paradise have some of the most famous mating displays in the world, but there's more to their colorful rhythmic gymnastics than initially meets the human eye.",https://www.sciencealert.com/most-birds-of-paradise-are-secretly-biofluorescent-study-finds,science,"Birds-of-paradise have some of the most famous mating displays in the world, but there's more to their colorful rhythmic gymnastics than initially meets the human eye.

For the first time, scientists have discovered these spectacular avians absolutely glowing with gorgeousness in a dark room.

Researchers at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) combed through the available archives and found that all 37 core bird-of-paradise species in Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia are biofluorescent. Only a few fringe family members fail to glow under ambient UV or blue light.

Most male birds tested possess brightly fluorescent heads, napes, bills, and plumes that glimmer with green or greenish-yellow hues. Some even have fluorescent legs, feet, tails, and rings around their eyes.

Many of these mysteriously colorful patches are starkly bordered by dark feathers with no fluorescence, and these parts of the body are often used in mating displays, when males flap, flutter, sway, bop, hang, and pose in an elaborate, attention-seeking dance that varies from species to species.

allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0″>

The current research was conducted among deceased birds of paradise, so it's unknown why these biofluorescent bits exist, or how the birds use them in the wild.

But because bird-of-paradise courtship relies on bright, colored plumage, lead author, evolutionary biologist Rene Martin, argues,""It seems fitting that these flashy birds are likely signaling to each other in additional, flashy ways"", making their display even more eye-catching.

Some male birds may even open up their glowing bills to show the female just how deep their beauty goes.

Before or during their courtship display in the wild, some male birds-of-paradise will raise their wings up to surround their face, creating what Martin and her colleagues describe as ""a dark black halo"".

In the center of this frame, the bird will open their bright, biofluorescent mouth for extended periods of time, up to 30 seconds or longer.

The researchers suspect that all core bird-of-paradise species possess fluorescent regions inside their mouths. Oftentimes, however, museum samples of these birds are preserved with beaks closed.

Other males from different species may use the bright fluorescent patches on the crown of their head as their 'feature' piece, contrasted by a black 'skirt' of feathers spread out below.

Because females sit on a branch above the male to watch his performance, this fluorescent head would pop from the darkness.

That's an interesting hypothesis, but it only explains one-half of the picture.

Thirty-six, possibly 37, species of female bird-of-paradise were also found to fluoresce, albeit less brightly than the males, and their glowing parts were typically limited to the patterned and mottled feathers on their chest and belly.

Sometimes, the rings around female eyes also glowed, possibly used as a signal to other birds that they are watching.

More research is needed but it's possible females are using this biofluorescence for ""simultaneous camouflage and communication"", argues the team at AMNH.

Many bird species can see spectra in the ultraviolet sensitive (UVS) and violet sensitive (VS) wavelength ranges, and birds-of-paradise are thought to possess this skill as well.

These stunning creatures live in woodland habitats where an abundance of high-energy ambient UV and blue light trickles through the canopy to the forest floor, allowing for their skin or feathers to absorb certain wavelengths of light and fluoresce.

Before now, official accounts of biofluorescence among birds existed just for auks, puffins, penguins, nocturnal owls, nightjars, parrots, and bustards. What's more, only studies on auks, parrots, and puffins had considered how these elaborate feathers might play a role in courtship and copulation.

allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0″>

""Despite there being over 10,000 described avian species, with numerous studies that have documented their bright plumage, elaborate mating displays, and excellent vision, surprisingly very few have investigated the presence of biofluorescence,"" says museum curator John Sparks, who started this research at AMNH roughly a decade ago.

Sparks' and his colleagues' findings add to a growing list of overlooked organisms that may use biofluorescence, including platypuses, wombats, and sea turtles. What role, if any, these vivid colors play in the wild is a mystery that scientists are just beginning to crack.

The study was published in Royal Society Open Science."
Scientists Just Found The Perfect Disguise to Sneak Into a Termite Colony - ScienceAlert,"Beneath the rocky soil of Morocco, researchers have uncovered a surprising intruder living undetected inside termite colonies.",https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-found-the-perfect-disguise-to-sneak-into-a-termite-colony,science,"Beneath the rocky soil of Morocco, researchers have uncovered a surprising intruder living undetected inside termite colonies.

Few outsiders gain acceptance in termite society, but a species of blowfly has evolved an incredible multipart disguise that successfully fools termites, allowing its larvae to not just survive but seemingly thrive.

This has not been firmly documented previously in these flies, according to a new study. The authors say it was luck they discovered the fly larvae inhabiting colonies in the Anti-Atlas mountains of southern Morocco, where native harvester termites (Anacanthotermes ochraceus) build subterranean nests.

Evolutionary biologist Roger Vila from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Spain and his team study butterflies and ants, and since few butterflies were active that day due to recent rains, they looked for ants.

""When we lifted a stone we found a termite mound with three fly larvae that we had never seen before,"" Vila says. ""The water had probably flooded the deeper layers of the nest and the larvae had emerged onto the surface.""

Intrigued, the researchers returned three times. They lifted hundreds of stones but found only two more of the larvae, which were together in a termite mound.

This suggests the species is rare, Vila says. Phylogenomic analysis indicates the blowflies belong to the genus Rhyncomya, although more research is needed to investigate its abundance, along with other details about its biology and ecology.

What we know so far is already astounding, though.

Termites use their antennae to pat down and smell anyone who enters, helping them quickly identify trouble. Specialized soldier termites have giant mandibles for just such an occasion.

Yet with such enviable safety, climate control, and food security, it may be tempting for other insects to try infiltrating their colonies, despite the risk.

For part of their disguise, the blowfly larvae display a ""termite mask"" on their rear end. This consists of a fake head adorned with antennae and palps similar to those of a harvester termite.

The fake head also includes fake eyes, which look remarkably like harvester termite eyes. In reality, Vila notes, these are breathing holes.

""Most termites live several meters deep and have no visual perception,"" Vila says. ""However, harvester termites come out at dusk to collect grass, so they have functional eyes that the larvae are able to mimic with their spiracles.""

In addition to the fake termite head, larvae's bodies are covered with strange 'tentacles'. These are uncanny imitations of termite antennae, as the researchers demonstrated with scanning electron microscopy.

Unlike the fake head, these tentacles may be functional. The flies seem to actually use them for communicating with termites.

And since the larvae have so many of these protrusions, they're able to communicate with several termites at once.

Those are both impressive adaptations, but still not quite enough on their own.

Each termite colony has its own scent, shared by all members, and nobody gets in without it. Looking like a termite won't help if you don't smell right – intruders from other colonies are not welcome, and may be dismembered by soldiers.

But these fly larvae are pros. They don't just imitate a colony's scent; according to Vila, they match it perfectly.

""We quantified the chemical composition of these larvae and the result is surprising: They are indistinguishable from the termites in the colony where they live; they smell exactly the same,"" he says.

In the wild, the fly larvae had been in their hosts' food chambers when Vila and his colleagues found them. The researchers brought some back to a laboratory termite mound, where the larvae gravitated toward more populated areas.

Termites were highly attentive, flocking around the fly larvae and preening them. They also appeared to feed them.

""The larvae are not only tolerated, but they constantly communicate with the termites through contact with their antenna-like tentacles,"" Vila says. ""The termites even seem to feed them, although this has not yet been unequivocally demonstrated.""

Some humpback flies (Phoridae) also mimic termites, but they do it as adults, not larvae. They're also not closely related to these blowflies, suggesting the ruses evolved independently.

""The common ancestor of blowflies and humpback flies dates back more than 150 million years, much further than that which separates humans from mice. We are therefore confident that we have discovered a new case of social integration evolution,"" Vila says.

No other known species in the genus Rhyncomya exhibit a similar appearance or lifestyle, hinting at a relatively quick evolution.

""This discovery invites us to reconsider the limits and potential of symbiotic relationships and social parasitism in nature,"" Vila says.

""But, above all, we should realize how much we still do not know about the vast diversity and specialization of insects, which are essential organisms in ecosystems.""

The study was published in Current Biology."
Novak Djokovic says recent doping cases in tennis suggest ‘favoritism’ and are ‘not a good image for our sport’ - CNN,Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system as several players speak out in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/sport/novak-djokovic-jannik-sinner-doping-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,general,"CNN —

Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.

On Saturday, it had emerged that world No. 1 Sinner accepted a ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) from February 9 until May 4 to settle a case which had lingered over tennis for months after the 2025 Australian Open winner twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol in March last year.

He previously avoided suspension when the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced in August that he wasn’t at fault for the positive tests, but WADA later lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

That led to Sinner’s ongoing ban being announced last week, but the three-time grand slam champion will still be eligible to compete at the French Open, the next grand slam on the tennis calendar.

“It’s not a good image for our sport, that’s for sure,” Djokovic told a news conference ahead of his first-round match at the Qatar Open.

“I would say a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room – not just in the last few days but also the last few months – are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.

“The majority of the players don’t feel that it’s fair. The majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. And it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.”

Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, British tennis player Liam Broady said that he felt the ban was intended to “impact Jannik’s career as little as possible,” adding: “The ban ends the day before the Rome Masters, which is the biggest tournament in his home country and the perfect preparation for him to then go and play the French Open.

“I don’t think he loses any (ranking) points or his number one spot either, so it’s an interesting ban. I was speaking to some people earlier and they said it’s kind of like a Premier League footballer being banned over the summer (when they don’t play). It’s a difficult one.”

After his case first became public last year, Sinner revealed that his positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist. He said that his physiotherapist had been applying an over-the-counter spray to their own skin – not Sinner’s – to treat a small wound.

Initially avoiding suspension for the positive tests, Sinner was able to cement his position at the top of the world rankings and win grand slam titles at the 2024 US Open and this year’s Australian Open.

How tennis authorities handled the case, and also that of women’s world No. 2 Iga Świątek, has drawn criticism. Świątek accepted a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, though the ITIA said that they found her “level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence.’”

Two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep criticized the “big difference in treatment” she received – being handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in September 2023 after testing positive for banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open – compared to Świątek. Halep maintained that her anti-doping violations were not intentional and, in March last year, CAS agreed and reduced the backdated ban to nine months, clearing her to return to the sport.

In response to Halep’s accusation of double standards, the ITIA told CNN at the time that it “deal(s) with each case based on the facts and evidence, not a player’s name, ranking or nationality.”

Halep retired from the sport earlier this month, saying that it was “very hard” to reach the high level of play she expected from herself.

“I think right now, it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work for anti-doping,” 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic said on Monday.

“The inconsistency is something that frustrates all the players,” he added. “If you’re going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what’s happening, then there is no consistency, then there is no transparency … Right now, there is a lack of trust generally from tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and the ITIA and the whole process.”

Australian player Nick Kyrgios, meanwhile, said in a post on X that he received messages from “multiple players” about “how putrid this is” after Sinner’s three-month ban was announced.

An ITIA spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday: “Each case is different, but the ITIA approaches them in the same way, irrespective of a player’s ranking or status. We understand that anti-doping is a complex and sometimes confusing topic, and commit significant time and resources into providing education and support to players to help them understand the rules and how they apply to them.

“We actively encourage players and their support staff to speak with the ITIA about any issues, concerns, or queries they have about the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme.”

Sinner’s representatives declined to comment further when contacted by CNN.

“This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” Sinner said in a previous statement about the ban.

“I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.”

On Saturday, WADA said that it “accepts that Mr. Sinner did not intend to cheat, and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit.”

In a new statement to CNN on Tuesday, it said: “WADA is satisfied that justice has been delivered in this case and that the sanction is appropriate for the violation that was committed.

“WADA is pleased to have been able to deal with this matter in an open and transparent fashion with the facts of the case available and in the public domain for people to read. The fairness delivered in this unique case (in that the sanction fits the violation) shows that the system works very well.”"
Leader of cultlike Zizians linked to 6 killings is due in a Maryland court - ABC News,The leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians that is linked to six killings in three states is due in a Maryland courtroom Tuesday along with two others,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/leader-cultlike-zizians-linked-6-killings-due-maryland-118925013,general,"The leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians that is linked to six killings in three states was ordered held without bail

By LEA SKENE Associated Press , HOLLY RAMER Associated Press , and PATRICK WHITTLE Associated Press

CUMBERLAND, Md. -- A Maryland court on Tuesday ordered a blogger known as Ziz who leads a cultlike group connected to six killings held without bail.

The blogger, Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California. They face charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in a vehicle.

The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other killings in three states.

LaSota, Zajko and Blank were arrested in Frostburg, Maryland, on Sunday afternoon.

The judge in the case ordered LaSota held without bail citing concerns about her being a flight risk and a danger to public safety. Prosecutors said LaSota “appears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians” that has been linked to killings.

The three were expected to appear remotely for a bail hearing Tuesday at Allegany District Court in Cumberland, Maryland, court officials said.

The Zizians have been tied to the death of a woman during an attack on a California landlord in November 2022, the landlord's subsequent slaying in January, the December 2022 deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania and a highway shootout last month in Vermont that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland and a car passenger dead.

A Frostburg resident told police he wanted three “suspicious” people off his property after they’d parked two box trucks there and asked to camp for a month, according to police documents.

They were dressed in black and two wore gun belts holding ammunition, according to police. Officers found a rifle in the back of one truck and a handgun on the front floorboard. Zajko, who refused to put her hands behind her back and was taken to the ground, also was carrying a handgun, police said.

Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Felix Bauckholt, a passenger in the car, also died, and the driver, Teresa Youngblut, has pleaded not guilty to federal firearms charges.

Officials have said the guns they were carrying were bought by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, and that Youngblut had been in close contact with a person of interest in a homicide in Vallejo, California.

Maximilian Snyder, who applied for a marriage license with Youngblut in November, is charged with the Jan. 17 stabbing death of Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had survived an earlier attack by members of the Zizian group and was set to testify against them.

Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, but Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.

Their goals aren’t clear, but online writings included topics such as radical veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence.

At the middle of it all is “Ziz,” the leader of the strange group whose members are sometimes called “Zizians” in online forums.

LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and “often desire to kill each other.”

LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.

LaSota has not responded to emails from the AP in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment on whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She’s wanted for arrest in two states for missing court appearances.

McGarrigle would only confirm Monday that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case. Attempts to reach attorneys for Zajko and Blank were not successful.

Pennsylvania state police records describe Daniel Blank as Michelle Zajko’s housemate in Vermont. In January 2023, police investigating the shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents detained both LaSota and Blank at a hotel where Zajko was staying. Blank was not charged. LaSota was charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.

Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family - BBC.com,The Palestinian group claims that Shiri and her children Kfir and Ariel were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,general,"Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family

The Bibas children Kfir and Ariel were the youngest hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas

Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned.

Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month.

The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.

Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.

In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.

In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"".

Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives.

An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named.

In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase.

""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter.

""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.

Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday.

They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time.

The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day.

They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.

Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.

Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.

But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.

Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"".

He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive.

""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said.

A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.

Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.

Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave."

His first stop is expected to be a welcome home party at a reservation casino, according to the NDN Collective, an indigenous rights group, where supporters plan to celebrate his release from what they claim was a ""wrongful incarceration.""

""Today I am finally free,"" Peltier said in a statement thanking supporters released by the collective after he left a federal prison in Sumterville, Florida. ""They may have imprisoned me, but they never took my spirit.""

In one of his last moves in office, former President Joe Biden granted Peltier clemency over fiery objections from both former FBI Director Christopher Wray and the FBI Agents Association. Peltier was seen boarding a chartered jet after his release and was expected to land in North Dakota before nightfall.

BIDEN FREES RADICAL LEFT-WING KILLER CONVICTED IN FBI AGENTS' MURDERS DURING LAST HOURS AS PRESIDENT

""I hope these letters are unnecessary, and that you are not considering a pardon or commutation,"" Wray wrote to Biden just 10 days before the former president granted clemency. ""But on behalf of the FBI family, and out of an abundance of caution, I want to make sure our position is clear: Peltier is a remorseless killer, who brutally murdered two of our own – Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law.""

Peltier was serving two consecutive life sentences for his role in the slayings of FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. He received another seven years on top of that for an armed escape attempt.

Special Agents Coler and Williams were stolen from their families, robbed of the chance to share precious time and milestones with their loved ones. Leonard Peltier should not have been granted a mercy he so cruelly denied to the Coler and Williams families. — Natalie Bara, president of the FBI Agents Association

A last-minute presidential pardon from Biden declared he should be freed Tuesday.

Peltier's most recent bid for parole failed in July. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both denied clemency requests for him, but he had supporters among other prominent Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , as well as former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland.

Members of law enforcement, and former FBI agents in particular, have been incensed by the clemency.

""[Peltier] executed the two agents when they were wounded on the ground – no mercy or forgiveness,"" Ed Mireles, the first FBI agent to receive the bureau's Medal of Valor after a deadly gun battle with two suspected killers in 1986, told Fox News Digital previously. ""No mercy or forgiveness for Peltier.""

Peltier was a member of the activist American Indian Movement, and his supporters have claimed he was denied a fair trial. But he was more than just an activist at the time of the FBI slayings at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota – he was the subject of an active arrest warrant for the attempted murder of a police officer in Wisconsin.

He has since portrayed himself as a political prisoner, a move that his Democratic supporters and other activists have embraced.

DOJ PANEL DENIES PAROLE TO FAR-LEFT ACTIVIST CONVICTED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 FBI AGENTS

On June 26, 1975, Williams and Coler were looking for a group of armed robbery suspects in the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

Although Peltier wasn't one of them, he was traveling in a vehicle that caught the agents' attention.

Williams and Coler warned over the radio that someone was about to open fire on them. They pleaded for help, but backup was miles away.

By the time help arrived, the agents were likely dead, but responding agents and local police also came under gunfire.

In the aftermath, investigators found 125 bullet holes in the agents' car and said they returned only five shots.

Both had been injured in the ambush and died from execution-style wounds to the head from a .223-caliber bullet. Peltier was the only person on scene carrying a weapon that could have fired those rounds, according to the FBI – an AR-15 rifle.

FAR-LEFT ACTIVIST CONVICTED IN EXECUTIONS OF 2 FBI AGENTS HEADED TO PAROLE HEARING WITH SUPPORT FROM DEMS

Four men were arrested in their deaths, but only Peltier was convicted, according to the FBI.

The government dropped charges against James Eagle, the robbery suspect whom Williams and Coler were looking for at the start of the shootout.

Two other men, Robert Robideau and Darrelle Butler, were acquitted at trial in 1976.

DEMOCRATS CALL ON BIDEN TO RELEASE LEONARD PELTIER, ACTIVIST WHO FATALLY SHOT TWO FBI AGENTS

Peltier's appeals have repeatedly failed, and according to the FBI, he admitted to firing at the agents on multiple occasions. The bureau says he told Canadian police, who arrested him after he fled across the border, that he shot at FBI agents whom he thought had come to arrest him for his outstanding warrant. He admitted to shooting at them again in a 1991 interview with ""60 Minutes.""

Nevertheless, Peltier's supporters have argued that his initial 1977 conviction was based on shoddy evidence and ""prosecutorial misconduct."" He failed to have it overturned after more than a dozen appeals, including two that reached the Supreme Court.

""For nearly 50 years, no fewer than 22 federal judges, multiple parole boards, and six presidential administrations have evaluated the evidence and considered Peltier’s arguments,"" Wray wrote to Biden over the summer. ""Each has reached the same conclusion: Peltier’s claims are meritless and his convictions and sentence must stand.""

Biden countered that Peltier's support outweighed the courts and the concerns of Coler and Williams' families and colleagues.

""Tribal Nations, Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials (including the former U.S. Attorney whose office oversaw Mr. Peltier’s prosecution and appeal), dozens of lawmakers, and human rights organizations strongly support granting Mr. Peltier clemency, citing his advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community, and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison,"" Biden said in a statement on Jan. 20.

Peltier's sentence has been commuted to home confinement.

""Leonard Peltier has never expressed remorse for his actions,"" said Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association. ""Special Agents Coler and Williams were stolen from their families, robbed of the chance to share precious time and milestones with their loved ones. Leonard Peltier should not have been granted a mercy he so cruelly denied to the Coler and Williams families."""

DALLAS — For the first time in 53 years, Southwest Airlines is undergoing mass layoffs.

The Dallas-based company will lay off over 1,000 people, or one out of seven employees, at its corporate headquarters.

The unprecedented move comes amid a gigantic shakeup at one of North Texas's biggest employers. Steve Cosgrove, publisher of Airways magazine, said employees were struggling to cope with the uncertainty after layoffs were announced.

""I mean they were crying, their voices were breaking over the phone because they don't know if it's going to be the one-year employee or the 38-year employee that's going to get laid off,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's really shattered the culture there.""

The layoffs will not impact customer-facing and union roles such as flight attendants, pilots and gate agents, so customers may not immediately notice a change, Cosgrove said. Union employees being insulated from the layoffs has created an ""us versus them"" dynamic at headquarters, Cosgrove said.

""Some of the headquarters people feel that part of these layoffs was because of the raises the pilots and flight attendants got, which isn't true because they went without contracts for years,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's set up an us versus them situation in a company that was always all for one, one for all.""

The airline hopes to cut $500 million in expenses as the company works to become more profitable, Cosgrove said. The layoffs will only cut about half that goal amount, he said.

""I don't know how they do the other $200 million, maybe through improved efficiencies and stuff like that,"" Cosgrove said. ""This is such a cold and calculated corporate-type move that Southwest is not known for and the employees aren't used to, so it really did stun them when the email came out yesterday.""

One set of employees may be particularly affected by the layoffs, Cosgrove said. So-called ""love couples"" who met while working at Southwest, got married and continued working for the airline."

While the new league year technically doesn't begin until March 12, which is when signings and trades can become official, Tuesday marked the opening of the franchise tag window.

From now through 4 p.m. ET on March 4, all 32 teams are permitted to apply a franchise tag to one of their pending free agents. The one-year tender, which is fully guaranteed, is worth either the average of the top five salaries at the player's position, or 120% of the player's most recent salary (whichever is greater). Tagged players can still negotiate with other teams, but any offers they receive can be matched by the original team, and if the player departs, the acquiring team must surrender two first-round draft picks.

Transition tags can also be applied; these one-year offers allow the player to negotiate with other teams, but the original team receives no compensation if the player signs elsewhere.

Wall Street is coming off a winning week for the major averages. The Dow gained roughly 0.6% last week, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. The Nasdaq rose 2.6%.

Much of last week's advance came Thursday after President Donald Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs on countries with levies on U.S. goods soothed investors who worried the tariffs would be more stringent.

Stocks have been choppy to start the year. Investors have paid close attention to inflation data, hoping that it will continue to ease and keep the Federal Reserve on its path toward lowering rates.

""I think there's a not-zero chance that the Federal Reserve reverses course next year as inflation becomes a 2026 story,"" said Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. ""That's not being reflected in asset values at the present time. I'm more optimistic than I am pessimistic, but I think we also need to be realistic.""

Correction: The S&P 500 Index closed at a record high on Tuesday. An earlier blog post headline incorrectly described the close."

"Ethan Hawke: ‘When We Prioritize Money at All Costs, What We Get Is Generic Material’ - Variety","Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film ""Blue Moon.""",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/ethan-hawke-when-we-prioritize-money-we-get-generic-art-1236311507/,general,"Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film “Blue Moon” on Tuesday, saying that this diminishes when money is prioritized.

“Audiences have to care. They don’t sell. You guys, the community, has to make it important. For offensive art to have a place in our conversation, it has to be cared about,” Hawke said. “And when we prioritize money at all costs, what we get is generic material that appeals to the most amount of people and we’re told that’s the best. It’s a dance we all do together. If you love offensive art and you want it, demand it. Right now, people don’t think they’ll make any money off it so it doesn’t get made.”

The idea of “offensive art” is a theme in “Blue Moon,” which follows lyricist Lorenz Hart (Hawke), Richard Rodgers’ former creative partner, as he struggles with alcoholism and depression on the opening night of “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers’ first musical with Hammerstein. After opening night, Hart criticizes the show for being inoffensive and having too happy of an ending.

Added Linklater, “Offensive times conjure up offensive art maybe. But movies particularly have always been escapism, and in our movie he’s accusing ‘Oklahoma!’ of being escapist in the middle of the horrors of WWII. So I don’t know, I think most human psyches want to escape a bit. There’s probably less offensive art now than there has been in the past.”

“Blue Moon” marks Hawke and Linklater’s first film together in over a decade, since 2014’s “Boyhood.” Alongside Hawke as Hart, “Blue Moon” also stars Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Bobby Cannavale as a bartender named Eddie.

Hawke and Linklater have now worked on nine feature films together over the course of their careers, including the “Before” trilogy, “The Newton Boys” and “Fast Food Nation.” At a Venice Film Festival talk last year, Hawke discussed their collaboration and the genesis of “Blue Moon,” saying Linklater wanted to make the movie 12 years ago but said the actor was “still too attractive.”

“He’s like, ‘Cool, we’re going to make it, but we need to wait a while.’ Why do we need to wait a while? He said, ‘You’re still too attractive. We gotta wait til you’re a little less attractive.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Hawke said. “He’s like, ‘Just trust me. Let’s just put it in a drawer, and every couple of years let’s read it and see if we’re ready or not.’”

“Blue Moon” premieres at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday night."
Red Sox Receive Excellent News On Potential Superstar Target - NESN,The Red Sox on Tuesday received significant news about a star player who could be a massive target for Boston next offseason.,https://nesn.com/2025/02/red-sox-receive-excellent-news-on-potential-superstar-target/,general,"If the Red Sox want to bring Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to Boston, it appears the storied franchise will at least have an opportunity to state their case to the superstar slugger.

ESPN’s Jeff Passan on Tuesday morning reported Guerrero and the Blue Jays did not reach an agreement on a contract extension by the Monday night deadline the sides established. According to Passan, the four-time All-Star “does not plan to negotiate” a potential extension in-season, which sets the stage for Guerrero to hit free agency after the 2025 campaign.

This development could bode well for the Red Sox, for whom the 25-year-old reportedly “would love” to play if he ultimately leaves Toronto. Boston, meanwhile, reportedly is a big fan of Guerrero’s game, and one top MLB insider last month indicated Craig Breslow and company would have a “good shot” at landing the power-hitting first baseman if he hit the open market.

How good of a shot? Well, another MLB insider last month thought the Red Sox were dragging their feet on adding Alex Bregman because the organization intended to make an aggressive pursuit of Guerrero. Bregman ultimately landed in Boston, but the star infielder’s three-year pact with the club shouldn’t prevent it from going after Guerrero this winter.

No, there currently isn’t a tailor-made fit for Guerrero with the Red Sox. But when you consider the kind of damage he could do at Fenway Park, it’s a move Boston absolutely should explore when the time comes."
iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to Feature Same OLED Panel as Last Year's Pro Models - MacRumors,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel,...",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-air-to-use-samsung-m4-panel/,general,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel, according to the Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital.



Samsung's ""M"" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while ""14"" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. The ""M14"" panel was used in last year's Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models, and delivers a 30% increase in brightness along with improved longevity compared to the previous M13 panel, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of the blue-emitting layer.

Oddly, Samsung's latest Galaxy S25 Ultra uses an improved version of the older M13 panel, so it looks like the regular iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could well have an objectively better display in at least some respects.

Apple's use of the M14 panel for all models makes sense, as Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone 17 models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only ""Pro"" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature.

Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.

Last year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌iPhone‌ model, while the iPhone 17 Air – replacing the Plus model – is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max."
The OnePlus Watch 3 finally adds a proper rotating crown - The Verge,"The $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 improves battery life to five days, while adding Wear OS 5, dual-frequency GPS, and several new health features.",https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables,general,"is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

I’ve had the $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 for a few days, and so far, this isn’t an Android watch that flips the script. Instead, it’s a story about refinement (and playing a bit of catch-up), rather than pushing boundaries. And you know what? If it means a strong Google / Samsung alternative with a rotating crown that finally scrolls, I’m totally fine with that.

On the design front, the Watch 3 is quite similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, with a few key changes. The OLED display is a smidge larger and brighter at 2,200 nits, and the bezels are notably smaller, though that’s partially because of a slight design tweak. The screen is spiffy to look at, especially with the new video watchface where you can upload your own clips. (I, of course, have uploaded one of my cat asking for belly rubs.) The casing is still stainless steel, but there’s a new titanium physical bezel, too. It gives it a more classic analog look, but otherwise, this isn’t a dramatic change. My big design gripe is that the Watch 3 still only comes in a single 47mm size. It’s not horrible, but I have smaller wrists, and the lug gaps are notable. Offering just one size excludes folks with smaller wrists from comfortably using the Watch 3, and that feels like a missed opportunity.

I’ll forgive OnePlus this oversight now that there’s a proper rotating crown. This time, you can actually use it to scroll through screens — a baffling omission from the last watch. There are delightful haptics that go along with it, and while this isn’t a groundbreaking addition, it soothes my inner curmudgeon that OnePlus has seen the errors of its ways and now upholds the nerdy wearable covenant that a rotating crown must also scroll.

Battery life has also been improved from 100 hours to 120 hours — or five days with regular use and the always-on display turned off. Turning on the AOD shortens that to roughly three days. That’s fairly typical for all flagship smartwatches these days. In a power-saving mode, you can get up to 16 days. OnePlus says it’s managed to stuff a larger 631mAh battery in the Watch 3 using the same silicon nanostack battery as the OnePlus 13. Since it runs Wear OS 5, that should add some extra battery mileage. I haven’t been testing the watch long enough to definitively comment on battery life just yet, but I always appreciate faster charging. You can get a full day’s worth in about 10 minutes.

OnePlus says it changed the sensor layout and made tweaks to the materials to improve tracking accuracy. Speaking of sensors, the Watch 3 adds one for wrist temperature, an eight-channel optical heart rate sensor, and a 16-channel blood oxygen sensor. It’s also revamped the GPS with a “circular polarized antenna,” which it claims will help improve GPS maps in areas with tall buildings. I’m getting over a cold, so I haven’t had the chance to test this on a run yet, but I’ll see whether it makes a dramatic difference. Technically, the Watch 3 can also take EKGs, but that functionality won’t be available for users in the US or Canada. In a briefing, OnePlus spokesperson Spenser Blank said that’s because OnePlus hasn’t received FDA clearance but that, for “business reasons,” the company doesn’t plan on pursuing FDA clearance.

That’s disappointing given some of the new health features. The big one is OnePlus’ 60S Health Check-In, where you touch the side button and get a quick scan of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. European users will get EKGs included in Q2 2025. Also new is a vascular health test, which measures your arterial stiffness. It’s similar to a feature Oura introduced last year, and it’s meant to gauge your circulatory system’s overall state. (Mine is “normal.”)

Truly rude. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge Not sure what I’m supposed to feel about my moderate wellness. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge

With the Watch 3, OnePlus is refocusing a bit on sleep tracking and wellness. The company says sleep tracking has been overhauled, and you’ll now be able to use the watch to track snoring patterns to assess your breathing disruptions. Stress tracking has also been rebranded as “360 Mind and Body,” and it uses heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and activity intensity to approximate how you’re doing… with emoji. Depending on how it evaluates your stress, you might get recommendations for guided breathing. I’ve been running a beta version of the OHealth app with these updates, and so far, I have received more insights into sleep tracking — though I’m not entirely sold on the emoji. So far, all I’ve been is roasted for my “moderate” wellness.

A lot of these updates are things other competitors already have. They just have a OnePlus twist to them, and it’ll take me some more time to really put subtler software tweaks through the testing gauntlet. So far, though, wearing the Watch 3 is a pleasant reminder of how OnePlus has surprisingly emerged as a competitive alternative to Samsung and Google. But one change I know I don’t love is the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive than its predecessor — though Blank told me that the price increase has nothing to do with tariffs.

The OnePlus Watch 3 is available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on February 25th."
"Europe Approves First ""Disabled Astronaut"" for Long-Term ISS Mission—a Historic Leap for Space - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel","Space just took a historic leap forward, but not everyone is on board. A former Paralympian is about to break barriers that once seemed impossible. Despite skepticism, ESA has given the green light for something never done before.",https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/europes-first-disabled-astronaut-approved-for-long-term-iss-missions/,general,"John McFall, the European Space Agency (ESA)’s first para-astronaut, has been medically cleared for a long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS), ESA’s Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, Daniel Neuenschwander, confirmed this Friday. The decision marks a major step in space exploration, proving that disability does not disqualify individuals from reaching for the stars.

A Groundbreaking Step for Inclusive Spaceflight

McFall, a 43-year-old British national, lost his right leg above the knee in a motorcycle accident at age 19. Despite this, he became a Paralympic sprinter and later a surgeon, before being selected in 2022 as ESA’s first astronaut with a disability. His journey represents a turning point, not just in space exploration, but in the way society views physical limitations.

The announcement comes after the conclusion of Fly!, an ESA-led feasibility study that examined the challenges and possibilities of a para-astronaut working in microgravity. The results were clear: there are no obstacles preventing McFall from participating in a full mission.

To earn his certification, McFall had to demonstrate his ability to complete every required astronaut task, including emergency procedures, microgravity adaptation, and daily station operations. His performance exceeded expectations.

Neuenschwander admitted he initially anticipated potential challenges, but was “surprised” at how seamlessly McFall adapted. “Let’s not underestimate all elements linked to safety procedures when you operate on the International Space Station,” he noted.

Prosthetic Technology and Space Adaptation

While medical clearance is a major milestone, McFall’s prosthetic leg must still undergo rigorous qualification for space travel. Any object taken aboard the ISS must meet strict safety and operational standards, and his prosthesis is no exception. ESA is working with the German orthopedic company Ottobock to adapt the design for use in microgravity.

McFall sees this process as an opportunity not just for himself, but for millions of prosthetic users worldwide. “What we do in space should also benefit people on Earth,” he said, emphasizing the potential advancements in prosthetic technology that could come from this mission.

To ensure that his prosthesis performs safely in space, McFall has engaged in intensive testing, including cycling in a head-down position to assess how microgravity affects the fit and comfort of his artificial limb. These tests are crucial for both his safety and efficiency aboard the ISS.

The Road to an Official Mission

Though ESA has given the green light, McFall’s mission is not yet scheduled. The next phase involves determining the scientific objectives he will focus on during his stay aboard the ISS. His presence could lead to unique research on human adaptation to space, with a focus on prosthetics, mobility, and rehabilitation in microgravity.

This milestone also highlights the diverging approaches to diversity and inclusion in space programs worldwide. While ESA continues to champion an inclusive future for human spaceflight, the new U.S. administration under Donald Trump has pushed back against DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) initiatives.

Neuenschwander acknowledged this shift, stating, “We are stepping into a slightly changing world, from a DEI perspective, than that of one of our partners on the ISS.”

A Symbol of Change

McFall’s journey is more than just a personal achievement—it represents a broader cultural shift in space exploration. As agencies push for greater accessibility, the dream of space travel is no longer limited to those who fit traditional astronaut molds.

With the final steps underway, the world may soon witness history: the first para-astronaut living and working in space for six months, proving that the limits of the past do not define the future."

Novak Djokovic says recent doping cases in tennis suggest ‘favoritism’ and are ‘not a good image for our sport’ - CNN,Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system as several players speak out in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/sport/novak-djokovic-jannik-sinner-doping-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,politics,"CNN —

Novak Djokovic believes that “favoritism” is damaging tennis’ anti-doping system in light of Jannik Sinner’s three-month ban.

On Saturday, it had emerged that world No. 1 Sinner accepted a ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) from February 9 until May 4 to settle a case which had lingered over tennis for months after the 2025 Australian Open winner twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol in March last year.

He previously avoided suspension when the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced in August that he wasn’t at fault for the positive tests, but WADA later lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

That led to Sinner’s ongoing ban being announced last week, but the three-time grand slam champion will still be eligible to compete at the French Open, the next grand slam on the tennis calendar.

“It’s not a good image for our sport, that’s for sure,” Djokovic told a news conference ahead of his first-round match at the Qatar Open.

“I would say a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room – not just in the last few days but also the last few months – are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.

“The majority of the players don’t feel that it’s fair. The majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. And it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.”

Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, British tennis player Liam Broady said that he felt the ban was intended to “impact Jannik’s career as little as possible,” adding: “The ban ends the day before the Rome Masters, which is the biggest tournament in his home country and the perfect preparation for him to then go and play the French Open.

“I don’t think he loses any (ranking) points or his number one spot either, so it’s an interesting ban. I was speaking to some people earlier and they said it’s kind of like a Premier League footballer being banned over the summer (when they don’t play). It’s a difficult one.”

After his case first became public last year, Sinner revealed that his positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist. He said that his physiotherapist had been applying an over-the-counter spray to their own skin – not Sinner’s – to treat a small wound.

Initially avoiding suspension for the positive tests, Sinner was able to cement his position at the top of the world rankings and win grand slam titles at the 2024 US Open and this year’s Australian Open.

How tennis authorities handled the case, and also that of women’s world No. 2 Iga Świątek, has drawn criticism. Świątek accepted a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, though the ITIA said that they found her “level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence.’”

Two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep criticized the “big difference in treatment” she received – being handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in September 2023 after testing positive for banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open – compared to Świątek. Halep maintained that her anti-doping violations were not intentional and, in March last year, CAS agreed and reduced the backdated ban to nine months, clearing her to return to the sport.

In response to Halep’s accusation of double standards, the ITIA told CNN at the time that it “deal(s) with each case based on the facts and evidence, not a player’s name, ranking or nationality.”

Halep retired from the sport earlier this month, saying that it was “very hard” to reach the high level of play she expected from herself.

“I think right now, it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work for anti-doping,” 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic said on Monday.

“The inconsistency is something that frustrates all the players,” he added. “If you’re going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what’s happening, then there is no consistency, then there is no transparency … Right now, there is a lack of trust generally from tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and the ITIA and the whole process.”

Australian player Nick Kyrgios, meanwhile, said in a post on X that he received messages from “multiple players” about “how putrid this is” after Sinner’s three-month ban was announced.

An ITIA spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday: “Each case is different, but the ITIA approaches them in the same way, irrespective of a player’s ranking or status. We understand that anti-doping is a complex and sometimes confusing topic, and commit significant time and resources into providing education and support to players to help them understand the rules and how they apply to them.

“We actively encourage players and their support staff to speak with the ITIA about any issues, concerns, or queries they have about the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme.”

Sinner’s representatives declined to comment further when contacted by CNN.

“This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” Sinner said in a previous statement about the ban.

“I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.”

On Saturday, WADA said that it “accepts that Mr. Sinner did not intend to cheat, and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit.”

In a new statement to CNN on Tuesday, it said: “WADA is satisfied that justice has been delivered in this case and that the sanction is appropriate for the violation that was committed.

“WADA is pleased to have been able to deal with this matter in an open and transparent fashion with the facts of the case available and in the public domain for people to read. The fairness delivered in this unique case (in that the sanction fits the violation) shows that the system works very well.”"
Leader of cultlike Zizians linked to 6 killings is due in a Maryland court - ABC News,The leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians that is linked to six killings in three states is due in a Maryland courtroom Tuesday along with two others,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/leader-cultlike-zizians-linked-6-killings-due-maryland-118925013,politics,"The leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians that is linked to six killings in three states was ordered held without bail

By LEA SKENE Associated Press , HOLLY RAMER Associated Press , and PATRICK WHITTLE Associated Press

CUMBERLAND, Md. -- A Maryland court on Tuesday ordered a blogger known as Ziz who leads a cultlike group connected to six killings held without bail.

The blogger, Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California. They face charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in a vehicle.

The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other killings in three states.

LaSota, Zajko and Blank were arrested in Frostburg, Maryland, on Sunday afternoon.

The judge in the case ordered LaSota held without bail citing concerns about her being a flight risk and a danger to public safety. Prosecutors said LaSota “appears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians” that has been linked to killings.

The three were expected to appear remotely for a bail hearing Tuesday at Allegany District Court in Cumberland, Maryland, court officials said.

The Zizians have been tied to the death of a woman during an attack on a California landlord in November 2022, the landlord's subsequent slaying in January, the December 2022 deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania and a highway shootout last month in Vermont that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland and a car passenger dead.

A Frostburg resident told police he wanted three “suspicious” people off his property after they’d parked two box trucks there and asked to camp for a month, according to police documents.

They were dressed in black and two wore gun belts holding ammunition, according to police. Officers found a rifle in the back of one truck and a handgun on the front floorboard. Zajko, who refused to put her hands behind her back and was taken to the ground, also was carrying a handgun, police said.

Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Felix Bauckholt, a passenger in the car, also died, and the driver, Teresa Youngblut, has pleaded not guilty to federal firearms charges.

Officials have said the guns they were carrying were bought by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, and that Youngblut had been in close contact with a person of interest in a homicide in Vallejo, California.

Maximilian Snyder, who applied for a marriage license with Youngblut in November, is charged with the Jan. 17 stabbing death of Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had survived an earlier attack by members of the Zizian group and was set to testify against them.

Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, but Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.

Their goals aren’t clear, but online writings included topics such as radical veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence.

At the middle of it all is “Ziz,” the leader of the strange group whose members are sometimes called “Zizians” in online forums.

LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and “often desire to kill each other.”

LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.

LaSota has not responded to emails from the AP in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment on whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She’s wanted for arrest in two states for missing court appearances.

McGarrigle would only confirm Monday that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case. Attempts to reach attorneys for Zajko and Blank were not successful.

Pennsylvania state police records describe Daniel Blank as Michelle Zajko’s housemate in Vermont. In January 2023, police investigating the shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents detained both LaSota and Blank at a hotel where Zajko was staying. Blank was not charged. LaSota was charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.

Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family - BBC.com,The Palestinian group claims that Shiri and her children Kfir and Ariel were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,politics,"Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family

The Bibas children Kfir and Ariel were the youngest hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas

Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned.

Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month.

The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.

Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.

In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.

In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"".

Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives.

An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named.

In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase.

""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter.

""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.

Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday.

They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time.

The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day.

They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.

Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.

Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.

But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.

Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"".

He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive.

""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said.

A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.

Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.

Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave."

"Far-left activist Leonard Peltier, serving life in murders of 2 FBI agents, leaves prison under Biden clemency - Fox News",Killer and American Indian Movement activist Leonard Peltier to receive welcome home bash 49 years after conviction in FBI agents' murders at Pine Ridge.,https://www.foxnews.com/us/far-left-activist-leonard-peltier-serving-life-murders-2-fbi-agents-leaves-prison-under-biden-clemency,politics,"Leonard Peltier, the 80-year-old activist and ""remorseless killer"" who has been in prison for just shy of 50 years in connection with a 1975 ambush shooting that left two FBI agents dead on a South Dakota reservation, is headed home.

His first stop is expected to be a welcome home party at a reservation casino, according to the NDN Collective, an indigenous rights group, where supporters plan to celebrate his release from what they claim was a ""wrongful incarceration.""

""Today I am finally free,"" Peltier said in a statement thanking supporters released by the collective after he left a federal prison in Sumterville, Florida. ""They may have imprisoned me, but they never took my spirit.""

In one of his last moves in office, former President Joe Biden granted Peltier clemency over fiery objections from both former FBI Director Christopher Wray and the FBI Agents Association. Peltier was seen boarding a chartered jet after his release and was expected to land in North Dakota before nightfall.

BIDEN FREES RADICAL LEFT-WING KILLER CONVICTED IN FBI AGENTS' MURDERS DURING LAST HOURS AS PRESIDENT

""I hope these letters are unnecessary, and that you are not considering a pardon or commutation,"" Wray wrote to Biden just 10 days before the former president granted clemency. ""But on behalf of the FBI family, and out of an abundance of caution, I want to make sure our position is clear: Peltier is a remorseless killer, who brutally murdered two of our own – Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law.""

Peltier was serving two consecutive life sentences for his role in the slayings of FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. He received another seven years on top of that for an armed escape attempt.

Special Agents Coler and Williams were stolen from their families, robbed of the chance to share precious time and milestones with their loved ones. Leonard Peltier should not have been granted a mercy he so cruelly denied to the Coler and Williams families. — Natalie Bara, president of the FBI Agents Association

A last-minute presidential pardon from Biden declared he should be freed Tuesday.

Peltier's most recent bid for parole failed in July. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both denied clemency requests for him, but he had supporters among other prominent Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , as well as former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland.

Members of law enforcement, and former FBI agents in particular, have been incensed by the clemency.

""[Peltier] executed the two agents when they were wounded on the ground – no mercy or forgiveness,"" Ed Mireles, the first FBI agent to receive the bureau's Medal of Valor after a deadly gun battle with two suspected killers in 1986, told Fox News Digital previously. ""No mercy or forgiveness for Peltier.""

Peltier was a member of the activist American Indian Movement, and his supporters have claimed he was denied a fair trial. But he was more than just an activist at the time of the FBI slayings at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota – he was the subject of an active arrest warrant for the attempted murder of a police officer in Wisconsin.

He has since portrayed himself as a political prisoner, a move that his Democratic supporters and other activists have embraced.

DOJ PANEL DENIES PAROLE TO FAR-LEFT ACTIVIST CONVICTED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 FBI AGENTS

On June 26, 1975, Williams and Coler were looking for a group of armed robbery suspects in the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

Although Peltier wasn't one of them, he was traveling in a vehicle that caught the agents' attention.

Williams and Coler warned over the radio that someone was about to open fire on them. They pleaded for help, but backup was miles away.

Peltier is a remorseless killer, who brutally murdered two of our own – Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law. — Christopher Wray, former FBI director

By the time help arrived, the agents were likely dead, but responding agents and local police also came under gunfire.

In the aftermath, investigators found 125 bullet holes in the agents' car and said they returned only five shots.

Both had been injured in the ambush and died from execution-style wounds to the head from a .223-caliber bullet. Peltier was the only person on scene carrying a weapon that could have fired those rounds, according to the FBI – an AR-15 rifle.

FAR-LEFT ACTIVIST CONVICTED IN EXECUTIONS OF 2 FBI AGENTS HEADED TO PAROLE HEARING WITH SUPPORT FROM DEMS

Four men were arrested in their deaths, but only Peltier was convicted, according to the FBI.

The government dropped charges against James Eagle, the robbery suspect whom Williams and Coler were looking for at the start of the shootout.

Two other men, Robert Robideau and Darrelle Butler, were acquitted at trial in 1976.

DEMOCRATS CALL ON BIDEN TO RELEASE LEONARD PELTIER, ACTIVIST WHO FATALLY SHOT TWO FBI AGENTS

Peltier's appeals have repeatedly failed, and according to the FBI, he admitted to firing at the agents on multiple occasions. The bureau says he told Canadian police, who arrested him after he fled across the border, that he shot at FBI agents whom he thought had come to arrest him for his outstanding warrant. He admitted to shooting at them again in a 1991 interview with ""60 Minutes.""

Nevertheless, Peltier's supporters have argued that his initial 1977 conviction was based on shoddy evidence and ""prosecutorial misconduct."" He failed to have it overturned after more than a dozen appeals, including two that reached the Supreme Court.

""For nearly 50 years, no fewer than 22 federal judges, multiple parole boards, and six presidential administrations have evaluated the evidence and considered Peltier’s arguments,"" Wray wrote to Biden over the summer. ""Each has reached the same conclusion: Peltier’s claims are meritless and his convictions and sentence must stand.""

Biden countered that Peltier's support outweighed the courts and the concerns of Coler and Williams' families and colleagues.

""Tribal Nations, Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials (including the former U.S. Attorney whose office oversaw Mr. Peltier’s prosecution and appeal), dozens of lawmakers, and human rights organizations strongly support granting Mr. Peltier clemency, citing his advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community, and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison,"" Biden said in a statement on Jan. 20.

Peltier's sentence has been commuted to home confinement.

""Leonard Peltier has never expressed remorse for his actions,"" said Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association. ""Special Agents Coler and Williams were stolen from their families, robbed of the chance to share precious time and milestones with their loved ones. Leonard Peltier should not have been granted a mercy he so cruelly denied to the Coler and Williams families."""

DALLAS — For the first time in 53 years, Southwest Airlines is undergoing mass layoffs.

The Dallas-based company will lay off over 1,000 people, or one out of seven employees, at its corporate headquarters.

The unprecedented move comes amid a gigantic shakeup at one of North Texas's biggest employers. Steve Cosgrove, publisher of Airways magazine, said employees were struggling to cope with the uncertainty after layoffs were announced.

""I mean they were crying, their voices were breaking over the phone because they don't know if it's going to be the one-year employee or the 38-year employee that's going to get laid off,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's really shattered the culture there.""

The layoffs will not impact customer-facing and union roles such as flight attendants, pilots and gate agents, so customers may not immediately notice a change, Cosgrove said. Union employees being insulated from the layoffs has created an ""us versus them"" dynamic at headquarters, Cosgrove said.

""Some of the headquarters people feel that part of these layoffs was because of the raises the pilots and flight attendants got, which isn't true because they went without contracts for years,"" Cosgrove said. ""It's set up an us versus them situation in a company that was always all for one, one for all.""

The airline hopes to cut $500 million in expenses as the company works to become more profitable, Cosgrove said. The layoffs will only cut about half that goal amount, he said.

""I don't know how they do the other $200 million, maybe through improved efficiencies and stuff like that,"" Cosgrove said. ""This is such a cold and calculated corporate-type move that Southwest is not known for and the employees aren't used to, so it really did stun them when the email came out yesterday.""

One set of employees may be particularly affected by the layoffs, Cosgrove said. So-called ""love couples"" who met while working at Southwest, got married and continued working for the airline."

While the new league year technically doesn't begin until March 12, which is when signings and trades can become official, Tuesday marked the opening of the franchise tag window.

From now through 4 p.m. ET on March 4, all 32 teams are permitted to apply a franchise tag to one of their pending free agents. The one-year tender, which is fully guaranteed, is worth either the average of the top five salaries at the player's position, or 120% of the player's most recent salary (whichever is greater). Tagged players can still negotiate with other teams, but any offers they receive can be matched by the original team, and if the player departs, the acquiring team must surrender two first-round draft picks.

Transition tags can also be applied; these one-year offers allow the player to negotiate with other teams, but the original team receives no compensation if the player signs elsewhere.

The S&P 500 closed at a record high Tuesday after stocks rallied seconds before the closing bell, as investors shook off headwinds on the global trade and inflation fronts.

The broad market index gained 0.24% to a record close of 6,129.58, after touching an intraday record of 6,129.63 before the final bell. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.07% at 20,041.26, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10 points, or 0.02%, to finish the session at 44,556.34.

Energy was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, rising 1.9%. Halliburton and Valero Energy led the advance. Tech stocks also ticked higher.

That said, pullbacks about 1% in consumer discretionary and 1.2% for communication services weighed on the broader market. Meta Platforms closed down 2.7% and snapped a 20-day winning streak.

""Overall, the market is still trying to break out of the consolidation it's been in since early December,"" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. ""This week kicks off the retail portion of earnings season, but news out of Washington, especially on the tariff front, could continue to be a wild card for the markets.""

Wall Street is coming off a winning week for the major averages. The Dow gained roughly 0.6% last week, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. The Nasdaq rose 2.6%.

Much of last week's advance came Thursday after President Donald Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs on countries with levies on U.S. goods soothed investors who worried the tariffs would be more stringent.

Stocks have been choppy to start the year. Investors have paid close attention to inflation data, hoping that it will continue to ease and keep the Federal Reserve on its path toward lowering rates.

""I think there's a not-zero chance that the Federal Reserve reverses course next year as inflation becomes a 2026 story,"" said Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. ""That's not being reflected in asset values at the present time. I'm more optimistic than I am pessimistic, but I think we also need to be realistic.""

"Ethan Hawke: ‘When We Prioritize Money at All Costs, What We Get Is Generic Material’ - Variety","Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film ""Blue Moon.""",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/ethan-hawke-when-we-prioritize-money-we-get-generic-art-1236311507/,politics,"Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film “Blue Moon” on Tuesday, saying that this diminishes when money is prioritized.

“Audiences have to care. They don’t sell. You guys, the community, has to make it important. For offensive art to have a place in our conversation, it has to be cared about,” Hawke said. “And when we prioritize money at all costs, what we get is generic material that appeals to the most amount of people and we’re told that’s the best. It’s a dance we all do together. If you love offensive art and you want it, demand it. Right now, people don’t think they’ll make any money off it so it doesn’t get made.”

The idea of “offensive art” is a theme in “Blue Moon,” which follows lyricist Lorenz Hart (Hawke), Richard Rodgers’ former creative partner, as he struggles with alcoholism and depression on the opening night of “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers’ first musical with Hammerstein. After opening night, Hart criticizes the show for being inoffensive and having too happy of an ending.

Popular on Variety

Added Linklater, “Offensive times conjure up offensive art maybe. But movies particularly have always been escapism, and in our movie he’s accusing ‘Oklahoma!’ of being escapist in the middle of the horrors of WWII. So I don’t know, I think most human psyches want to escape a bit. There’s probably less offensive art now than there has been in the past.”

“Blue Moon” marks Hawke and Linklater’s first film together in over a decade, since 2014’s “Boyhood.” Alongside Hawke as Hart, “Blue Moon” also stars Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Bobby Cannavale as a bartender named Eddie.

Hawke and Linklater have now worked on nine feature films together over the course of their careers, including the “Before” trilogy, “The Newton Boys” and “Fast Food Nation.” At a Venice Film Festival talk last year, Hawke discussed their collaboration and the genesis of “Blue Moon,” saying Linklater wanted to make the movie 12 years ago but said the actor was “still too attractive.”

“He’s like, ‘Cool, we’re going to make it, but we need to wait a while.’ Why do we need to wait a while? He said, ‘You’re still too attractive. We gotta wait til you’re a little less attractive.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Hawke said. “He’s like, ‘Just trust me. Let’s just put it in a drawer, and every couple of years let’s read it and see if we’re ready or not.’”

“Blue Moon” premieres at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday night."
Red Sox Receive Excellent News On Potential Superstar Target - NESN,The Red Sox on Tuesday received significant news about a star player who could be a massive target for Boston next offseason.,https://nesn.com/2025/02/red-sox-receive-excellent-news-on-potential-superstar-target/,politics,"If the Red Sox want to bring Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to Boston, it appears the storied franchise will at least have an opportunity to state their case to the superstar slugger.

ESPN’s Jeff Passan on Tuesday morning reported Guerrero and the Blue Jays did not reach an agreement on a contract extension by the Monday night deadline the sides established. According to Passan, the four-time All-Star “does not plan to negotiate” a potential extension in-season, which sets the stage for Guerrero to hit free agency after the 2025 campaign.

This development could bode well for the Red Sox, for whom the 25-year-old reportedly “would love” to play if he ultimately leaves Toronto. Boston, meanwhile, reportedly is a big fan of Guerrero’s game, and one top MLB insider last month indicated Craig Breslow and company would have a “good shot” at landing the power-hitting first baseman if he hit the open market.

How good of a shot? Well, another MLB insider last month thought the Red Sox were dragging their feet on adding Alex Bregman because the organization intended to make an aggressive pursuit of Guerrero. Bregman ultimately landed in Boston, but the star infielder’s three-year pact with the club shouldn’t prevent it from going after Guerrero this winter.

No, there currently isn’t a tailor-made fit for Guerrero with the Red Sox. But when you consider the kind of damage he could do at Fenway Park, it’s a move Boston absolutely should explore when the time comes."
iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to Feature Same OLED Panel as Last Year's Pro Models - MacRumors,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel,...",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-air-to-use-samsung-m4-panel/,politics,"All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance ""M14"" OLED display panel, according to the Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital.



Samsung's ""M"" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while ""14"" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. The ""M14"" panel was used in last year's Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models, and delivers a 30% increase in brightness along with improved longevity compared to the previous M13 panel, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of the blue-emitting layer.

Oddly, Samsung's latest Galaxy S25 Ultra uses an improved version of the older M13 panel, so it looks like the regular iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could well have an objectively better display in at least some respects.

Apple's use of the M14 panel for all models makes sense, as Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone 17 models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only ""Pro"" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature.

Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.

Last year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌iPhone‌ model, while the iPhone 17 Air – replacing the Plus model – is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max."
The OnePlus Watch 3 finally adds a proper rotating crown - The Verge,"The $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 improves battery life to five days, while adding Wear OS 5, dual-frequency GPS, and several new health features.",https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables,politics,"is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

I’ve had the $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 for a few days, and so far, this isn’t an Android watch that flips the script. Instead, it’s a story about refinement (and playing a bit of catch-up), rather than pushing boundaries. And you know what? If it means a strong Google / Samsung alternative with a rotating crown that finally scrolls, I’m totally fine with that.

On the design front, the Watch 3 is quite similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, with a few key changes. The OLED display is a smidge larger and brighter at 2,200 nits, and the bezels are notably smaller, though that’s partially because of a slight design tweak. The screen is spiffy to look at, especially with the new video watchface where you can upload your own clips. (I, of course, have uploaded one of my cat asking for belly rubs.) The casing is still stainless steel, but there’s a new titanium physical bezel, too. It gives it a more classic analog look, but otherwise, this isn’t a dramatic change. My big design gripe is that the Watch 3 still only comes in a single 47mm size. It’s not horrible, but I have smaller wrists, and the lug gaps are notable. Offering just one size excludes folks with smaller wrists from comfortably using the Watch 3, and that feels like a missed opportunity.

You can see the difference between the new physical bezel and screen size from the OnePlus Watch 3 (right) to the previous OnePlus Watch 2 (left). Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge and Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge

I’ll forgive OnePlus this oversight now that there’s a proper rotating crown. This time, you can actually use it to scroll through screens — a baffling omission from the last watch. There are delightful haptics that go along with it, and while this isn’t a groundbreaking addition, it soothes my inner curmudgeon that OnePlus has seen the errors of its ways and now upholds the nerdy wearable covenant that a rotating crown must also scroll.

Battery life has also been improved from 100 hours to 120 hours — or five days with regular use and the always-on display turned off. Turning on the AOD shortens that to roughly three days. That’s fairly typical for all flagship smartwatches these days. In a power-saving mode, you can get up to 16 days. OnePlus says it’s managed to stuff a larger 631mAh battery in the Watch 3 using the same silicon nanostack battery as the OnePlus 13. Since it runs Wear OS 5, that should add some extra battery mileage. I haven’t been testing the watch long enough to definitively comment on battery life just yet, but I always appreciate faster charging. You can get a full day’s worth in about 10 minutes.

OnePlus says it changed the sensor layout and made tweaks to the materials to improve tracking accuracy. Speaking of sensors, the Watch 3 adds one for wrist temperature, an eight-channel optical heart rate sensor, and a 16-channel blood oxygen sensor. It’s also revamped the GPS with a “circular polarized antenna,” which it claims will help improve GPS maps in areas with tall buildings. I’m getting over a cold, so I haven’t had the chance to test this on a run yet, but I’ll see whether it makes a dramatic difference. Technically, the Watch 3 can also take EKGs, but that functionality won’t be available for users in the US or Canada. In a briefing, OnePlus spokesperson Spenser Blank said that’s because OnePlus hasn’t received FDA clearance but that, for “business reasons,” the company doesn’t plan on pursuing FDA clearance.

That’s disappointing given some of the new health features. The big one is OnePlus’ 60S Health Check-In, where you touch the side button and get a quick scan of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. European users will get EKGs included in Q2 2025. Also new is a vascular health test, which measures your arterial stiffness. It’s similar to a feature Oura introduced last year, and it’s meant to gauge your circulatory system’s overall state. (Mine is “normal.”)

Truly rude. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge Not sure what I’m supposed to feel about my moderate wellness. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge

With the Watch 3, OnePlus is refocusing a bit on sleep tracking and wellness. The company says sleep tracking has been overhauled, and you’ll now be able to use the watch to track snoring patterns to assess your breathing disruptions. Stress tracking has also been rebranded as “360 Mind and Body,” and it uses heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and activity intensity to approximate how you’re doing… with emoji. Depending on how it evaluates your stress, you might get recommendations for guided breathing. I’ve been running a beta version of the OHealth app with these updates, and so far, I have received more insights into sleep tracking — though I’m not entirely sold on the emoji. So far, all I’ve been is roasted for my “moderate” wellness.

A lot of these updates are things other competitors already have. They just have a OnePlus twist to them, and it’ll take me some more time to really put subtler software tweaks through the testing gauntlet. So far, though, wearing the Watch 3 is a pleasant reminder of how OnePlus has surprisingly emerged as a competitive alternative to Samsung and Google. But one change I know I don’t love is the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive than its predecessor — though Blank told me that the price increase has nothing to do with tariffs.

The OnePlus Watch 3 is available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on February 25th."

McFall, a 43-year-old British national, lost his right leg above the knee in a motorcycle accident at age 19. Despite this, he became a Paralympic sprinter and later a surgeon, before being selected in 2022 as ESA’s first astronaut with a disability. His journey represents a turning point, not just in space exploration, but in the way society views physical limitations.

The announcement comes after the conclusion of Fly!, an ESA-led feasibility study that examined the challenges and possibilities of a para-astronaut working in microgravity. The results were clear: there are no obstacles preventing McFall from participating in a full mission.

To earn his certification, McFall had to demonstrate his ability to complete every required astronaut task, including emergency procedures, microgravity adaptation, and daily station operations. His performance exceeded expectations.

Neuenschwander admitted he initially anticipated potential challenges, but was “surprised” at how seamlessly McFall adapted. “Let’s not underestimate all elements linked to safety procedures when you operate on the International Space Station,” he noted.

Prosthetic Technology and Space Adaptation

While medical clearance is a major milestone, McFall’s prosthetic leg must still undergo rigorous qualification for space travel. Any object taken aboard the ISS must meet strict safety and operational standards, and his prosthesis is no exception. ESA is working with the German orthopedic company Ottobock to adapt the design for use in microgravity.

McFall sees this process as an opportunity not just for himself, but for millions of prosthetic users worldwide. “What we do in space should also benefit people on Earth,” he said, emphasizing the potential advancements in prosthetic technology that could come from this mission.

To ensure that his prosthesis performs safely in space, McFall has engaged in intensive testing, including cycling in a head-down position to assess how microgravity affects the fit and comfort of his artificial limb. These tests are crucial for both his safety and efficiency aboard the ISS.

The Road to an Official Mission

Though ESA has given the green light, McFall’s mission is not yet scheduled. The next phase involves determining the scientific objectives he will focus on during his stay aboard the ISS. His presence could lead to unique research on human adaptation to space, with a focus on prosthetics, mobility, and rehabilitation in microgravity.

This milestone also highlights the diverging approaches to diversity and inclusion in space programs worldwide. While ESA continues to champion an inclusive future for human spaceflight, the new U.S. administration under Donald Trump has pushed back against DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) initiatives.

Neuenschwander acknowledged this shift, stating, “We are stepping into a slightly changing world, from a DEI perspective, than that of one of our partners on the ISS.”

A Symbol of Change

McFall’s journey is more than just a personal achievement—it represents a broader cultural shift in space exploration. As agencies push for greater accessibility, the dream of space travel is no longer limited to those who fit traditional astronaut molds.

With the final steps underway, the world may soon witness history: the first para-astronaut living and working in space for six months, proving that the limits of the past do not define the future."

Nike is in a slump. It’s hired Kim Kardashian to help - CNN,"Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/business/nike-skims-new-brand/index.html,gaming,"New York CNN —

Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.

Nike is partnering with Kardashian for a new brand called “NikeSkims,” the company and fashion mogul jointly announced Tuesday. The collection, which is based on her popular shapewear line, “will disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry with best-in-class innovation in service of all women athletes,” according to a press release.

Few details were initially made available, including pricing and images. However, the brand will first roll out in the United States this spring online and at “select retail locations,” with a global launch planned in 2026.

The new collection is a first for Nike, which hasn’t partnered with an outside company before to create a new brand, rather relying on acquisitions or tapping popular athletes (i.e. Michael Jordan) for apparel. Financial terms of the brand wasn’t revealed.

Nike said that Skims “proposed a shared product line,” but suggested “something even bigger,” thus the creation of NikeSkims. “More than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories,” the press release stated.

The new brand will help Nike be more relevant in the activewear category, helping it compete against Lululemon and Alo, which is an area “where it has been flagging and playing second fiddle,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.

“In theory, Nike should have all the skills needed to drive its own brand in womenswear, but the reality is it has lost some of its ability to story tell, innovate and wow consumers,” Saunders told CNN. “Partnering with Skims remedies some of those weaknesses.”

Skims has been a major success story for Kardashian with the privately held company valued at a whopping $4 billion as of July 2023. The brand is aimed at everyday wear expanding beyond women with a men’s lineup and inking sponsorships with the NBA, WNBA and Team USA for the most recent Olympics in Paris.

Meanwhile, Nike faces tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Plus, customers are changing their behavior, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike recently changed CEOs to help turn it around.

Nike (NKE) reported an 8% drop in sales in its most recent quarter, signaling the company is still struggling. However, shares perked up following the Kardashian news — rising nearly 3% — in early trading. Meanwhile, Lululemon (LULU) shares fell nearly the same amount."
"Ethan Hawke: ‘When We Prioritize Money at All Costs, What We Get Is Generic Material’ - Variety","Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film ""Blue Moon.""",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/ethan-hawke-when-we-prioritize-money-we-get-generic-art-1236311507/,gaming,"Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film “Blue Moon” on Tuesday, saying that this diminishes when money is prioritized.

“Audiences have to care. They don’t sell. You guys, the community, has to make it important. For offensive art to have a place in our conversation, it has to be cared about,” Hawke said. “And when we prioritize money at all costs, what we get is generic material that appeals to the most amount of people and we’re told that’s the best. It’s a dance we all do together. If you love offensive art and you want it, demand it. Right now, people don’t think they’ll make any money off it so it doesn’t get made.”

The idea of “offensive art” is a theme in “Blue Moon,” which follows lyricist Lorenz Hart (Hawke), Richard Rodgers’ former creative partner, as he struggles with alcoholism and depression on the opening night of “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers’ first musical with Hammerstein. After opening night, Hart criticizes the show for being inoffensive and having too happy of an ending.

Popular on Variety

Added Linklater, “Offensive times conjure up offensive art maybe. But movies particularly have always been escapism, and in our movie he’s accusing ‘Oklahoma!’ of being escapist in the middle of the horrors of WWII. So I don’t know, I think most human psyches want to escape a bit. There’s probably less offensive art now than there has been in the past.”

“Blue Moon” marks Hawke and Linklater’s first film together in over a decade, since 2014’s “Boyhood.” Alongside Hawke as Hart, “Blue Moon” also stars Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Bobby Cannavale as a bartender named Eddie.

Hawke and Linklater have now worked on nine feature films together over the course of their careers, including the “Before” trilogy, “The Newton Boys” and “Fast Food Nation.” At a Venice Film Festival talk last year, Hawke discussed their collaboration and the genesis of “Blue Moon,” saying Linklater wanted to make the movie 12 years ago but said the actor was “still too attractive.”

“He’s like, ‘Cool, we’re going to make it, but we need to wait a while.’ Why do we need to wait a while? He said, ‘You’re still too attractive. We gotta wait til you’re a little less attractive.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Hawke said. “He’s like, ‘Just trust me. Let’s just put it in a drawer, and every couple of years let’s read it and see if we’re ready or not.’”

“Blue Moon” premieres at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday night."
Meghan puts a new label on her jams and lifestyle range - BBC.com,"The Duchess of Sussex reveals ""As Ever"" will be the new name for her home and cooking range.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0lde201jo,gaming,"Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range

1 day ago Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent

Instagram Meghan's lifestyle brand is now going to be called 'As Ever'

Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever. Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post.

The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title.

If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as ""whatever"". Appropriately, she signed off her own post: ""As ever, Meghan."""

Millie Bobby Brown, a Pisces. Photo-Illustration: by The Cut; Photo: Getty Images

Lately, it’s been challenging to get close to the people around you — you’re so different from each other. You can come up with plenty of reasons why it’s not even worth it to try. But when the sun enters Pisces this morning, those differences won’t seem so insurmountable.Today, it’ll become possible to find surprising common ground with others, and to connect on a deep and genuine level.

Aries Daily Horoscope

Today you might be filled with wistfulness, nostalgia, and maybe a bit of regret. If you let yourself reminisce and reflect, deeply buried emotions could come up. While your natural tendency might be to immediately do something about whatever you’re feeling now, try to be patient. You’re likely only to cause problems for yourself if you rush to take action without giving yourself any time to process. Sitting with your feelings probably doesn’t sound particularly useful or exciting, but for now, it could be the best use of your time.

Taurus Daily Horoscope

You can be incredibly generous with the people in your life. When they need help, you offer what you can, whether that’s resources, time, or just a listening ear. You’d never judge or resent your friends for needing support — but you tend to think that you shouldn’t ever need a hand, and that successes somehow don’t “count” unless you achieved them on your own. Today, it’s time to recognize that you’re being unfair to yourself. When you need help, you’re only holding yourself back by not asking for it.

Gemini Daily Horoscope

Sometimes, you get the sense that you’re falling behind. You imagine that you should be much farther along in your career, or that your personal life shouldn’t be so messy, or simply that you should feel more mature and more capable than you do. Today, remember that you’re on your own timeline, not anyone else’s. If you compare yourself to the people around you, you’ll inevitably feel inadequate, but if you trust that you’re moving at the right pace for you, it’ll be much easier to get where you want to go.

Cancer Daily Horoscope

You’re brave and determined, but at a certain point, you get tired of meeting challenge after challenge with courage and integrity. Today, you might feel particularly drained; you just want to hide from it all. Right now though, the best way to care for yourself isn’t to retreat from the world around you, but to engage with it. You don’t need to go on big adventures if you’re not up for it, but seeing new sights and interacting with people will fill your cup more than sitting at home.

Leo Daily Horoscope

You tend to express your opinions forcefully, and you stand by them, often doubling down when others challenge you. But even if you’re right almost all of the time, there will still be instances when you misjudge people, jump to the wrong conclusion, and say things you regret. Your pride makes it hard to admit when you’ve made a mistake, but today, it might get a bit easier to show yourself grace. You’re not responsible for knowing all the answers, only for being willing to learn and grow.

Virgo Daily Horoscope

You often underestimate the effect you have on the people around you. It might seem like they aren’t paying attention to you, like they’re only half-listening when you share your ideas — but in fact, you hold more sway than you realize. Your friends look up to you, they want you to think well of them, and they take your feedback seriously — even if they don’t always show it. Don’t hesitate to speak up today; the people in your life are listening more closely than you realize.

Libra Daily Horoscope

The harder you work, the more you care about getting results. It’s hard to see the point of putting real effort into a project if you’re not going to get anywhere, or investing time into a relationship that might not work out. It’s reasonable to feel this way; the problem is that you can’t always control outcomes — especially when other people are in the mix. Today, focus on the process. If you take each step with intention, you’ll be able to hold your head up high whatever happens in the end.

Scorpio Daily Horoscope

It’s all too easy to become convinced that your actions don’t matter — the world is vast and you’re only one person; you struggle to see how anything you do could make a difference. But thinking this way helps nobody, so today, push back against it. You don’t need to make grand, impressive gestures — simply connecting with other people, and putting your energy to good use instead of letting it wither away inside you, is enough. It’s not about convincing anyone else that you’re powerful, but about reminding yourself.

Sagittarius Daily Horoscope

In general, you’re a big-picture kind of thinker; you’re good at seeing the patterns that your more detail-oriented friends tend to miss, and you’re good at coming up with grand, unifying theories about the world. Today though, remember there are exceptions to every rule. People won’t always behave the way you expect them to, and your own thoughts and feelings often break the mold, too. Give everyone, including yourself, the space to be who they actually are, not who you think they’re supposed to be.

Capricorn Daily Horoscope

You probably aren’t the sort of person who enjoys arguing for its own sake, but you’re not one to shy away from it, either. If someone is unfairly criticizing you, you’ll fight back; if they’re making claims that you know are untrue, you’ll set the record straight. You care about being right, and you want everyone else to recognize that you know what you’re talking about. Sometimes, though, it gets exhausting to feel like you always have to prove yourself. Today, try to put more energy into connecting with other people than in deciding who’s “right.”

Aquarius Daily Horoscope

Your own comfort isn’t generally a top priority for you — maybe because you’re too busy ruminating on bigger ideas to worry about something so trivial, or maybe because you imagine that you don’t really deserve to feel at ease. But today, make an effort to be kind to yourself. Give a bit of extra attention to your emotional and physical needs. Neglecting yourself won’t make you wiser or a “better person” — it’ll only make everything else more difficult.

Pisces Daily Horoscope

When you aren’t sure what kind of life you want to live, or how you should be spending your time, it’s only natural to look to the people around you for guidance. Navigating the world can be confusing, and it can be helpful to see how others do it. Today, just make sure you’re not putting too much stock in the actions of other people: they’re on their own paths, and your job isn’t to follow them, but to find yours. You’re wiser than you sometimes give yourself credit for, so trust your instincts.

Victoria Jackson, a staunch Trump supporter, is making her anger known to TMZ, pointing us to a post by political commentator Link Lauren, who calls out the ""MAGA = racist"" trope as ""downright disgusting"" -- a sentiment VJ says summarizes her feelings.

Victoria -- who was a cast member from '86 to '92 -- calls the whole thing ""stupid,"" adding she was also offended by the sexual vulgarity on the show.

Tom Hanks just came out on SNL in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a black man’s hand.



This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. SNL is an unfunny show… pic.twitter.com/PlSc7gmiJ0 — Link Lauren (@itslinklauren) February 17, 2025 @itslinklauren

Victoria, who was on the red carpet at last night's show, notes another ex-cast member next to her laughed at the ""crude jokes,"" sarcastically adding the show seemed to have something for everyone -- but then quips, ""Did anyone make fun of the Kamala supporters?!""

In Link’s X post -- which Victoria says perfectly captured her feelings -- he slammed Hanks’ skit where he played a Trump supporter who acted like he was scared to shake a Black man’s hand -- calling it the reason why the show’s ratings ""are in the gutter."""
'The Brutalist' Director Brady Corbet Says He Made No Money From the Film - Hollywood Reporter,"“I've spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can't pay their rent,"" Corbet said. ""I mean, that's a real thing.""",http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-brutalist-brady-corbet-made-no-money-1236139785/,gaming,"The Brutalist director Brady Corbet said this week he “made zero dollars” on his Oscar-nominated film.

“I just directed three advertisements in Portugal,” Corbet said during an appearance on WTF With Marc Maron. “It’s the first time that I had made any money in years.”

Corbet went on to elaborate that he and his wife (and creative partner) Mona Fastvold, “made zero dollars on the last two films that we made.”

Before The Brutalist, Corbet and Fastvold made 2018’s Vox Lux. The Brutalist earned 10 nominations for this year’s Academy Awards, including best actor for Adrien Brody, best supporting actress for Felicity Jones, best director for Corbet and best picture.

When Maron asked Corbet to clarify his comments about payment, the director said, “Yes. Actually, zero. We had to just sort of live off of a paycheck from three years ago.”

The financial toll is not exclusive to Corbet, he said. “I’ve spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can’t pay their rent. I mean, that’s a real thing.”

The director went on to note that filmmakers are “not paid to be promoting a film,” and that “if you look at certain films that premiered in Cannes, that was almost a year ago … I mean, our film premiered in September. So I’ve been doing this for six months. And had zero income because I don’t have any time to go to work. I can’t even take a writing job at the moment.”

Corbet said the lengthy press circuit feels like “a six-month interrogation,” later saying he completed 90 interviews last week.

“It’s seven days a week,” he said. “It’s boundless. It’s constant travel, and you’re also working Saturdays and Sundays. I haven’t had a day off since the Christmas break, and that was also only four days.”"

Bethenny Frankel has praised Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for showing up to the “SNL” 50th anniversary special on Sunday amid their ongoing legal fight with Lively’s “It Ends With Us” co-star and director, Justin Baldoni.

In the first of two videos posted to her Instagram on Monday, the former “Real Housewives of New York” star, 54, also lauded “SNL” for including the stars in the special, adding that the couple’s decision to poke fun at their battle with Baldoni was “nothing short of genius.”

“Absolutely brilliant of ‘SNL’ to invite and include Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively to lean into the humor,” Frankel began. “They are the epicenter of pop culture. It is the zeitgeist. Bullseye.”

She continued, “And for Ryan and Blake to participate is nothing short of genius, because the only way to weather a storm is to go straight through it.”

“And as I keep saying, no one knows what actually happened,” the Skinny Girl founder added, referring to Lively and Baldoni’s contradictory claims about the drama that unfolded behind the scenes during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

“So all of this speculation is a tricky and risky business. But that was very smart. Bravo,” Frankel concluded.

Reynolds nodded to his and Lively’s drama with Baldoni an hour into “SNL 50” during a segment where Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took questions from the star-studded audience in Rockefeller Center’s Studio 8H.

“Ryan Reynolds, how’s it going?” Poehler, 53, asked.

Reynolds then quipped, “Why? What have you heard?”

After facing criticism for her remarks in the comments, Frankel posted another clip, in which she declared she “is tripling down.”

“So many comments on ‘SNL’ and I am tripling down and saying that ‘SNL’ was nothing short of brilliant for having them on last night,” she told viewers. “It’s marketing genius.”

“They are the epicenter. They are the zeitgeist that is popular culture. They often have disruptive people on,” Frankel said of the sketch comedy show.”They talk about disruptive topics They will have both political candidates on. They will have people mocking both political candidates. So from their standpoint, it was nothing short of brilliant.”

Turning to Lively and Reynolds, the reality TV star said, “Whether you like them or not, [it] was smart of Blake and Ryan to go [to ‘SNL 50’].”

Frankel did, however, point out that she was speaking only from a marketing perspective, alluding to the allegations of sexual harassment Lively has leveled against Baldoni and the domestic violence at the center of the story in “It Ends With Us.”

“Now there’s a conversation about it being tone-deaf because of the topic.

“So that’s a separate conversation,” Frankel stressed. “But from a marketing standpoint, it was a great idea on everyone’s part.

Referring to social media sleuths, she added, “Not everyone lives in the bowels of Tik-Tok reading every single legal document and knows every single thing that you guys all know.”

“Even Candace Owens would likely agree that ‘SNL’ was brilliant from a marketing standpoint,” Frankel said of the conservative commentator, who has been a vocal critic of Reynolds and Lively.

“She may not like it, and many of you don’t like the ‘ick’ of all of it, but that’s a touching story. From a marketing standpoint, it was smart.”

In December 2024, Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, accusing him of sexual harassment and orchestrating a public smear campaign against her.

Baldoni countersued her and Reynolds, 48, alleging defamation, extortion and more. Both stars have denied the other’s claims through their respective lawyers.

The legal war between Lively and Baldoni shows no sign of cooling down, with mediation seeming unlikely. On Friday, attorneys for both stars told Judge Lewis Liman that “settlement discussions would be premature,” according to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by Fox News Digital.

Lively and Baldoni’s trial is set for March 2026."

‘Last Week Tonight’ YouTube Release Delay Eliminated After John Oliver Called It “Massively Frustrating” - Deadline,'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. The episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/last-week-tonight-john-oliver-youtube-release-schedule-1236293211/,gaming,"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. To fans’ surprise and delight, the episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.

This is a reversal of the release pattern HBO implemented last season, pushing the release of each new Sunday night episode’s main story on YouTube from the following Monday to the following Thursday in an effort to drive up subscribers to the Max streaming service. The move triggered backlash among fans and was called “massively frustrating” by Oliver.

HBO made an exception for Last Week Tonight‘s pre-election episode last November. That episode’s main segment, in which Oliver spoke of “the damage of a second Trump term,” urging everyone to vote for Kamala Harris, was released on YouTube shortly after the show had aired on the linear HBO network on the West Coast.

Watch on Deadline

At the time, HBO insiders stressed that the quick YouTube release was a one-off. It is now once again becoming the norm. The reversal decision, which Oliver had been advocating for, was made after data analysis didn’t reveal a significant increase in Max viewership after implementing the delay, sources said.

As it’s always been the case, only Last Week Tonight episodes’ main story will be released on YouTube. Last night’s episode was an exception as Oliver devoted the entire show to Donald Trump’s first month in office and the actions of Elon Musk, whom he called “a parasitic freak,” and his DOGE team.

As a result, the full episode was released on YouTube Sunday night."
Shakira’s tour back on track after Peru concert cancelled due to hospital admission - CNN,"Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/entertainment/shakira-hospital-peru-concert-cancelled-scli-intl/index.html,gaming,"CNN —

Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.

Master Live, the company organizing Shakira’s concert in Lima, confirmed on Monday that the event scheduled for Monday, February 17 at the National Stadium in Peru’s capital at 8:15 p.m. local time will take place.

“We are pleased to inform that today’s concert will take place as normal. We want to thank Shakira for all the effort to make this show go ahead,” the statement from Master Live said.

Master Live added in its statement that they will announce the new date for the concert on Sunday that was canceled.

Posting to Instagram on Sunday, the singer previously said she had been taken to the emergency room and was advised to cancel the concert.

“The doctors whose care I am currently under have communicated that I am not in good enough condition to perform this evening,” she said.

“I am very sad to not be able to take (to) the stage today. I’ve been looking forward to reuniting with my incredible fans here in Peru,” Shakira said, adding that she hoped to be discharged soon.

“My team and the promoters are already working on a new date to communicate to you,” she added. So far there is no statement confirming that the singer has already left the hospital.

CNN is trying to contact Shakira’s team for more information. Meanwhile, Shakira’s social media has posted announcements of Monday’s concert and the list of songs that the Colombian singer is expected to sing tonight in Lima.

In a previous post, Shakira had thanked her Peruvian fans for a warm welcome to the country alongside a series of photos showing the singer greeting crowds of well wishers.

The singer recently embarked on a world tour and is set to play shows in various Latin American countries before embarking on a US leg of the tour starting May 13 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The tour is named “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,” or “Women Don’t Cry Anymore.”

Shakira is considered one of the most popular Latin American recording artists of the early 21st century.

However, she’s faced some controversy in recent years.

In November 2023, Shakira settled her tax evasion suit with the Spanish authorities.

The Grammy-winning singer admitted the charges against her and agreed to pay the amount owed in full and an additional fine, according to a statement released by the Barcelona prosecutor’s office at the time.

She paid a total of €17.5 million ($19 million), an amount composed of the taxes she owed plus interest, as well as a fine of €7.3 million ($8 million), the statement said."

Matt Damon Is Odysseus in First Image from Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Odyssey’ - IndieWire,Matt Damon plays the Greek soldier Odysseus in the first look at Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey.',https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/christopher-nolan-the-odyssey-first-look-matt-damon-1235096411/,gaming,"On President’s Day, cinephiles got their first look at what just might be the most anticipated movie of 2026: Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey.” Universal took to its official social media accounts to release the first photo from the film, which shows Matt Damon in costume as Odysseus, the mythical Greek hero who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War.

Damon was one of the first cast members announced for Nolan’s film, and was soon joined by Tom Holland, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong’o, Benny Safdie, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, and Elliot Page. None of the casting announcements have been accompanied by news about who is playing which character from Homer’s epic poem — though that did not stop fans from speculating that Holland could be playing Odysseus’ son Telemachus — so Universal’s post marks the first official confirmation that Damon is playing the titular role.

Announced in December 2024, Nolan’s take on “The Odyssey” will be his 13th feature film. The box office success and Oscar dominance of “Oppenheimer” ensured that Nolan’s follow-up would be among the most coveted projects in Hollywood for actors and studios alike. Despite rumors of outreach from his former home Warner Bros., where he had worked for decades prior to “Oppenheimer,” Nolan opted to return to Universal for “The Odyssey.”

“Christopher Nolan’s next film ‘The Odyssey’ is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” the studio wrote in a post on X announcing the film in December. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.”

Nolan is unsurprisingly expected to shoot the film in IMAX formats, with production taking place in 2026 in Sicily, England, and Morocco. Many of the Sicilian islands are believed to be the locations Homer was referencing in his original text, as global borders have been significantly redrawn in the last three thousand years. It appears that Nolan is devoting the extensive Hollywood resources at his disposal to capturing the foundational text with an eye for both its epic scale and period detail.

A Universal release, “The Odyssey” opens in theaters on July 17, 2026."
Netflix Doc Reveals That Gabby Petito Called an Ex-Boyfriend for Comfort Hours Before Her Death - Variety,Netflix's 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' unpacks her disappearance and shows Gabby Petito called an ex-boyfriend for comfort hours before her death.,https://variety.com/2025/streaming/features/gabby-petito-american-murder-netflix-called-ex-boyfriend-before-death-1236310695/,gaming,"It’s been three and a half years since Gabby Petito made headlines around the world after she vanished during a cross-country road trip she was taking with her fiance Brian Laundrie. Now, a new three-part docuseries, “American Murder: Gabby Petito,” goes beyond the headlines to reveal the reality of a 22-year-old woman enmeshed in an abusive relationship.

After Petito disappeared in August 2021, Laundrie returned to his parents’ house in North Port, Fla., where he refused to discuss Petito’s whereabouts. Laundrie’s refusal to speak to the police caused a media firestorm, which escalated when Petito’s body was found in Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest on Sept. 19, 2021. An autopsy concluded that Petito died by homicide. Laundrie, who was eventually revealed to be the killer, died by suicide in October 2021.

The series, directed by Julia Willoughby Nason and Michael Gasparro, features Peitito’s family and several of her close friends. Never-before-seen text messages, police body cam footage, and excerpts from Petito’s personal journal are also used to tell Petito’s story. Notably, the doc uses outtakes from Petito’s #Vanlife Vlog, which reveal that her happy, “Insta-perfect” face for social media was, especially in the last few weeks of her life, a facade.

Popular on Variety

The docuseries marks the third installment of Netflix’s “American Murder” franchise. “American Murder: The Family Next Door” streamed in 2020 and was followed by 2024’s “American Murder: Laci Peterson.”

Variety spoke to Willoughby Nason and Gasparro about accessing police body cam footage, Brian Laundrie’s parents, and what surprised them about the Petito case.

In the series, Gabby’s biological parents, as well as both of her stepparents, are very candid about their daughter and her murder, which seemed painful to recount. How did you convince the family to participate? Were they paid?

Gasparro: No. This was all about The Gabby Petito Foundation. Netflix doesn’t do a lot of action items, or cards (listing foundations) or anything like that because it’s a documentary. But we were able to get a clip into episode three where the family was able to talk about the foundation. So, the whole goal here is to push people towards The Gabby Petito Foundation, which helps bring awareness to domestic violence.

Did you find it difficult to ask to do those interviews since you were asking people to recount the worst weeks of their lives?

Willoughby Nason: We do very long interviews. So, we had time with the family to unpack things, to take breaks, and to slow down. Having done these kinds of interviews over the years with families who have lost loved ones, I see how hard it is for them to relive and tell these stories, but I think it’s also very healing and cathartic to be able to speak about what they are feeling on a daily basis because it doesn’t go away unfortunately for them.

Did the family provide you with all the unseen footage from Gabby’s #Vanlife Vlog?

Gasparro: Yes. When we met with her parents, they gave us all this stuff to go through, which included all of Gabby’s journals, all of her artwork, and then all the footage. Her curated #Vanlife footage proves what a great editor she was. She knew what she was doing, and she was very determined. But the (outtakes) allow you to unpack her journey, and that, to us, was amazing. It was really just a way to help tell the story through her.

In the series, it’s revealed that Gabby called an ex-boyfriend in the days leading up to her disappearance and on the day detectives think she was murdered. Did that surprise you?

Gasparro: Yes. We didn’t know about that. We didn’t know she had reached out to him during a vulnerable time (during her trip with Brian). She was obviously suffering. She trusted her ex and reached out. It was like a cry for help. We think that’s probably something that Brian caught wind of.

When Petito went missing, a snippet of the police bodycam footage captured on Aug. 12, 2021 in Moab, Utah of Gabby and Brian circulated in newsfeeds around the country. In your series, you reveal the entirety of the bodycam footage for the first time. How did you get all of that unseen footage?

Gasparro: Through FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests.

The footage is pretty infuriating. Did you ask the Moab police who were involved with the incident for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes, but they declined.

I’m assuming you also asked Brian’s parents – Christopher and Roberta Laundrie – for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes. They also declined. We had to respect that. You can only do so much, and we are not a news organization. We are not going to stand on their lawn and beg them to be on the series. For us, it was about telling Gabby’s story first and foremost. People tend to love to tell the story about the murderer, but we felt Gabby’s story was more important.

After this process, do you think Brian’s family knew that he murdered Gabby long before his confession letter was found?

Willoughby Nason: Based on the phone records that we highlight in the series, we know that Brian called his parents for almost an hour from Wyoming around the time Gabby went missing. I think to us, that really tips the hat that something was communicated there early on between his family. We don’t know what, but we do know that he told his dad, ‘Gabby’s gone, and I need a lawyer.’ We see in the phone records that the parents contacted a lawyer in Wyoming right after Brian’s call to them. So, it’s suspicious.

Were there any interesting things that you learned while making the film that you couldn’t fit into the series?

Willoughby Nason: I learned that Gabby was a prolific artist and that she was very industrious in terms of wanting to be an influencer and how to build this van. All of this was her idea.

Gasparro: There was an entire cross-country trip that they took prior to moving to Florida that we didn’t know about, but we had to move things along for the viewer.

Dr. Phil served as an executive producer on this series. How did that happen?

Gasparro: Sarah Carden (“Dr. Phil” senior supervising news producer) reached out to us and said that she loved “Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal,” which we made for Netflix in 2023. She told us that the (Petito) family, who had a relationship with Dr. Phil, wanted to tell their story because they hadn’t actually sat down or partnered with anybody to tell Gabby’s story. They had done sit-down interviews while everything was unpacking, but Sarah said that they wanted filmmakers like us to tell Gabby’s story.

‘Captain America: Brave New World’ Opened to $100 Million. Does a ‘B-’ CinemaScore Spell Trouble For Staying Power? - Variety,"""Captain America: Brave New World"" opened to a mighty $100 million. But how will the superhero sequel hold in subsequent weeks at the box office?",https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/captain-america-brave-new-world-box-office-staying-power-marvel-cinematic-universe-1236310075/,gaming,"“Captain America: Brave New World” proves that Marvel hasn’t lost its mojo. The fourth “Captain America” installment, and the first in which Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield, delivered a mighty $100 million in its domestic debut over the extended Presidents Day weekend. The film added another $92.4 million overseas for a $192.4 million global tally, easily the best start of the (nascent) year.

Yet opening weekends are rarely a problem for Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. To wit: All 35 films in the sprawling comic book franchise have launched to No. 1, even the ones described by critics as a “pile of dirt.” So in the case of “Captain America: Brave New World,” all eyes will be on the staying power — industry parlance for how a movie’s ticket sales hold (or don’t) in the subsequent weekends on the big screen.

Popular on Variety

That’s of paramount concern because the all-powerful MCU has struggled with commercial consistency since the epic success of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” and these superhero sequels don’t come cheap. “Captain America: Brave New World” cost north of $180 million to make and at least $100 million to market across the globe. And it’s just one of three Marvel movies this year with “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” to follow in the summer.

“When you look at the release calendar, I don’t see anything that can cut into ‘Captain America,'” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “If audiences want to be entertained at a blockbuster level, it’s their only option.”

Indeed, there’s nothing resembling a four-quadrant blockbuster on the calendar until Disney’s “Snow White” remake on March 21. So cinema operators need “Captain America: Brave New World” to endure on the scale of 2023’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” rather than “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Marvels” to be deemed a financial winner.

“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” powered to $118 million domestically at the start of that summer’s movie season and continued to draw audiences in the following weekends, with revenues declining by 47% in its second and third outing and 35% in its fourth frame. Those were decent holds compared to other superhero films of its size. The third “Guardians” ended its run with $358 million in North America and a sizable $845 million globally. That’s the best case scenario for Cap’s latest cinematic adventure.

Yet the reality is that even Marvel’s biggest blockbusters have plunged after record-breaking debuts in the post-“Endgame” era. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and “Thor: Love and Thunder,” which earned $955 million and $760 million respectively in 2022, each declined 67% in their sophomore outings.

Then there’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania,” which scored a trilogy-best $120 million debut over Presidents Day weekend in 2023. Saddled with some of the worst reviews of any MCU film, ticket sales collapsed by 70% in its second weekend. The film ultimately failed to cross the $500 million mark worldwide, a modest benchmark for Marvel. Not to be outdone, “The Marvels,” the sole MCU movie to flop out of the gate, took a 78% nosedive in its second weekend.

“This has a chance to have long playability. ‘Ant-Man’ didn’t have that,” says Bock, referring to sleeper hits like “Cocaine Bear” and “Jesus Revolution,” both of which opened the weekend after “Quantumania.”

For “Captain America: Brave New World,” reviews and audience reactions aren’t exactly encouraging for the film’s theatrical endurance. The movie has dismal marks, at least by MCU standards, with a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and lousy “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls.

However there are signs, beyond a lack of competition, that Cap and company could withstand the bad buzz and give the box office a needed boost. The film boasted a strong turnout across all demographics; 35% of opening weekend ticket buyers were Caucasian, 26% were Latino and Hispanic, 23% were Black and 10% were Asian. It’s a sign the tentpole has the kind of broad appeal that’s necessary to boost a given movie from mere hit to runaway (Hulk) smash.

Moreover, sources close to the superhero adaptation believe that CinemaScore isn’t the best measure of moviegoer reception. They feel that way because those grades are bestowed after polling patrons in just a few theaters. On Rotten Tomatoes, a more expansive metric, “Captain America: Brave New World” has a stronger 80% “verified audience score.” (“Quantumania” has an 81% “verified audience score.”) PostTrak, another metric to poll moviegoers, reported that parents and kids gave the film four out of five stars. However, general audiences handed out three of five stars.

“Captain America: Brave New World” was also popular in premium formats with Imax, Dolby and other like formats accounting for 44% of inaugural sales. Those tickets are more expensive than standard 2D screens and have helped to offset a downward trend in attendance.

“We’re very happy on our side,” says Chris Randleman of Texas-based luxury movie theater chain Flix Brewhouse. “Walk-up business has been great despite the reviews. It’s an accessible film with a clear hook.”

He adds, “It’s going to look like ticket sales had a big drop. But that’s because this weekend is inflated with the double holiday of Valentine’s Day and Presidents Day.”

VIP+ Analysis: ‘Captain America’ Sequel Anything but Brave New Era for Aging Marvel IP

After the embarrassing misfires of “Ant-Man” and “The Marvels,” Disney’s CEO Bob Iger announced a company-wide mandate to focus on quality over quantity. “At the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,” Iger said during a 2023 earnings call. “We lost some focus.”

That year, in addition to the three theatrical releases, there were three Disney+ television series. Then, 2024 marked an aberration with just one film (along with another three seasons of television) on the calendar. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” an R-rated buddy comedy led by two of the most popular comic book characters, became an unmitigated smash with $1.33 billion globally.

Marvel is back to regularly scheduled programming with another two tentpoles on schedule over the next six months: “Thunderbolts” on May 2 and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” on July 25. Amid those megawatt titles, DC Comics has “Superman,” a Man of Steel reboot from director James Gunn, on July 11. Hollywood is banking on this year’s quartet of comic book offerings to revive the hit-or-miss superhero genre.

“The industry needs Marvel. No other film is opening to over $100 million in February,” says Bock. “Having three of them on the calendar is a bright spot.”"
'SNL50' didn't do justice to the past 50 years of comedy: Review - USA TODAY,"""Saturday Night Live"" cast past and present tried their best to make a 50th anniversary special, but failed to make it as good as regular ""SNL.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/02/17/snl-50-anniversary-special-review/78908273007/,gaming,"Fifty years of ""Saturday Night Live"" is a lot of history, legacy and pressure to pack into a one-night special, even if it's 3½ hours long.

But producer Lorne Michaels and the ""SNL"" cast and writers, past and present, tried to do just that in the show's 50th anniversary special Sunday on NBC, a star-studded black-tie bacchanalia of celebrity cameos, sketch revivals and self-congratulatory montages that gave it the flavor of an awards show crossed with an extended episode of ""SNL"" crossed with a drunken party that should have been attended only by people who have actually worked on the show. The special even featured an ""In Memoriam"" segment, although it was reserved for all the offensive and poorly aged sketches over the years (and to remind us they re-aired a lot of the racist and sexist stuff).

It was a tonnage of effort and personality smushed onto the Studio 8H stage, and it all added up to something that was, well, fine? You could call it serviceable, checking nostalgia boxes while trying desperately to remain relevant to the youth of today, with more screen time for Sabrina Carpenter than Bill Murray. It had almost all the still-living heavy hitters from the series' history doing chuckle-worthy monologues and sketches. It was humorous, if not hilarious. And if we hadn't seen a similar but far better version of this a decade ago when the show celebrated its 40th anniversary, it might have been more satisfactory.

Maybe producers didn't want to repeat the classic sketches used in 2015, leaving the 50th stuck with the also-rans and ones that are less than a year old. The only advantage ""SNL50"" had over ""SNL40"" is that this time, Eddie Murphy actually appeared in sketches. But overall, it was a wasted opportunity to do something slightly different and far more transcendent.

The night started sleepily, and it was difficult to build energy. Opening with Carpenter, the hot pop star of the moment, and Paul Simon, an ""SNL"" staple since the show's second episode and a close friend of Michaels', was clearly an effort to marry the past and present, young and old. But the choice of ballad ""Homeward Bound"" made the cold open somber and slow. A monologue from consummate host Steve Martin brought a little bit of verve (especially his ""Gulf of America"" joke), but the momentum careened to a halt with a reprisal of Kristen Wiig's tiny-handed Dooneese sketch that went on far too long and for some reason included Kim Kardashian.

The rest of the evening veered from adequate to mediocre, with a flash or two of genuine brilliance. Murphy put his whole heart and soul into a Tracy Morgan impression for the ""Black Jeopardy!"" sketch that was, honest to goodness, the best thing the 63-year-old comedian and movie star has done in a decade. Mike Myers' classic ""Coffee Talk"" character Linda Richman joined Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler for ""Bronx Beat,"" a crossover that was smooth as buttah. But that was all alongside another edition of this season's already overplayed ""Domingo"" sketch, Murphy in a cringeworthy ""Scared Straight"" bit, and Kate McKinnon's usually hilarious alien abductee, who was upstaged by a fuzzy Meryl Streep cameo.

Nearly every sketch could have used the ruthless red pen of an editor as it dragged on to fill time. Most also felt as if they were only 80% finished. A New York history-themed installment of John Mulaney's trademark musical parodies featured some good moments, but it also felt as if it had no point. Plus we got another one of these back in November, the last time Mulaney hosted. Did we really need another one so soon?'

It's such a shame, because ""SNL40"" felt so essential to any fan of the series because the sketches were both familiar and novel: a ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"" that honored Will Ferrell and Norm Macdonald but left room for current cast member McKinnon to shine. A digital short from Andy Samberg and Adam Sandler making fun of cast members who ""break"" and giggle during a sketch. They were sketches that felt as if they could happen only on an anniversary show, and not just because of all the cameos; it's because they truly honored the show's legacy past and present. ""SNL50"" merely managed a handful of unsuccessful attempts to mesh what the show was with what it is now. But by the time Paul McCartney closed out the show, it felt as if we had all taken a dose of the ""After Update"" sleeping pill Alec Baldwin joked about in his short appearance.

A half-century in, ""SNL"" is something too big to be contained, let alone distilled into something succinct and sensational. Any version of a 50th anniversary special would likely disappoint in some way; there's just too much history here to get in everything everyone wants to see. But the version of the special Michaels and the writers created didn't have the sparkle of the show at its height.

It's nostalgic to watch the re-creations of the ""SNL"" of the past, but maybe we're better off just rewatching the sketches that made the show a cultural landmark in the first place."

Nike is in a slump. Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.

Nike is partnering with Kardashian for a new brand called “NikeSkims,” the company and fashion mogul jointly announced Tuesday. The collection, which is based on her popular shapewear line, “will disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry with best-in-class innovation in service of all women athletes,” according to a press release.

Few details were initially made available, including pricing and images. However, the brand will first roll out in the United States this spring online and at “select retail locations,” with a global launch planned in 2026.

The new collection is a first for Nike, which hasn’t partnered with an outside company before to create a new brand, rather relying on acquisitions or tapping popular athletes (i.e. Michael Jordan) for apparel. Financial terms of the brand wasn’t revealed.

Nike said that Skims “proposed a shared product line,” but suggested “something even bigger,” thus the creation of NikeSkims. “More than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories,” the press release stated.

The new brand will help Nike be more relevant in the activewear category, helping it compete against Lululemon and Alo, which is an area “where it has been flagging and playing second fiddle,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.

“In theory, Nike should have all the skills needed to drive its own brand in womenswear, but the reality is it has lost some of its ability to story tell, innovate and wow consumers,” Saunders told CNN. “Partnering with Skims remedies some of those weaknesses.”

Skims has been a major success story for Kardashian with the privately held company valued at a whopping $4 billion as of July 2023. The brand is aimed at everyday wear expanding beyond women with a men’s lineup and inking sponsorships with the NBA, WNBA and Team USA for the most recent Olympics in Paris.

Meanwhile, Nike faces tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Plus, customers are changing their behavior, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike recently changed CEOs to help turn it around.

Nike (NKE) reported an 8% drop in sales in its most recent quarter, signaling the company is still struggling. However, shares perked up following the Kardashian news — rising nearly 3% — in early trading. Meanwhile, Lululemon (LULU) shares fell nearly the same amount."
"Ethan Hawke: ‘When We Prioritize Money at All Costs, What We Get Is Generic Material’ - Variety","Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film ""Blue Moon.""",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/ethan-hawke-when-we-prioritize-money-we-get-generic-art-1236311507/,music,"Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater spoke about taking risks in art at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for their new film “Blue Moon” on Tuesday, saying that this diminishes when money is prioritized.

“Audiences have to care. They don’t sell. You guys, the community, has to make it important. For offensive art to have a place in our conversation, it has to be cared about,” Hawke said. “And when we prioritize money at all costs, what we get is generic material that appeals to the most amount of people and we’re told that’s the best. It’s a dance we all do together. If you love offensive art and you want it, demand it. Right now, people don’t think they’ll make any money off it so it doesn’t get made.”

The idea of “offensive art” is a theme in “Blue Moon,” which follows lyricist Lorenz Hart (Hawke), Richard Rodgers’ former creative partner, as he struggles with alcoholism and depression on the opening night of “Oklahoma!,” Rodgers’ first musical with Hammerstein. After opening night, Hart criticizes the show for being inoffensive and having too happy of an ending.

Added Linklater, “Offensive times conjure up offensive art maybe. But movies particularly have always been escapism, and in our movie he’s accusing ‘Oklahoma!’ of being escapist in the middle of the horrors of WWII. So I don’t know, I think most human psyches want to escape a bit. There’s probably less offensive art now than there has been in the past.”

“Blue Moon” marks Hawke and Linklater’s first film together in over a decade, since 2014’s “Boyhood.” Alongside Hawke as Hart, “Blue Moon” also stars Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Margaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Bobby Cannavale as a bartender named Eddie.

Hawke and Linklater have now worked on nine feature films together over the course of their careers, including the “Before” trilogy, “The Newton Boys” and “Fast Food Nation.” At a Venice Film Festival talk last year, Hawke discussed their collaboration and the genesis of “Blue Moon,” saying Linklater wanted to make the movie 12 years ago but said the actor was “still too attractive.”

“He’s like, ‘Cool, we’re going to make it, but we need to wait a while.’ Why do we need to wait a while? He said, ‘You’re still too attractive. We gotta wait til you’re a little less attractive.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Hawke said. “He’s like, ‘Just trust me. Let’s just put it in a drawer, and every couple of years let’s read it and see if we’re ready or not.’”

“Blue Moon” premieres at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday night."
Meghan puts a new label on her jams and lifestyle range - BBC.com,"The Duchess of Sussex reveals ""As Ever"" will be the new name for her home and cooking range.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0lde201jo,music,"Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range

1 day ago Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent

Instagram Meghan's lifestyle brand is now going to be called 'As Ever'

Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever. Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post.

The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title.

If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as ""whatever"". Appropriately, she signed off her own post: ""As ever, Meghan."""

Millie Bobby Brown, a Pisces. Photo-Illustration: by The Cut; Photo: Getty Images

Lately, it’s been challenging to get close to the people around you — you’re so different from each other. You can come up with plenty of reasons why it’s not even worth it to try. But when the sun enters Pisces this morning, those differences won’t seem so insurmountable.Today, it’ll become possible to find surprising common ground with others, and to connect on a deep and genuine level.

Aries Daily Horoscope

Today you might be filled with wistfulness, nostalgia, and maybe a bit of regret. If you let yourself reminisce and reflect, deeply buried emotions could come up. While your natural tendency might be to immediately do something about whatever you’re feeling now, try to be patient. You’re likely only to cause problems for yourself if you rush to take action without giving yourself any time to process. Sitting with your feelings probably doesn’t sound particularly useful or exciting, but for now, it could be the best use of your time.

Taurus Daily Horoscope

You can be incredibly generous with the people in your life. When they need help, you offer what you can, whether that’s resources, time, or just a listening ear. You’d never judge or resent your friends for needing support — but you tend to think that you shouldn’t ever need a hand, and that successes somehow don’t “count” unless you achieved them on your own. Today, it’s time to recognize that you’re being unfair to yourself. When you need help, you’re only holding yourself back by not asking for it.

Gemini Daily Horoscope

Sometimes, you get the sense that you’re falling behind. You imagine that you should be much farther along in your career, or that your personal life shouldn’t be so messy, or simply that you should feel more mature and more capable than you do. Today, remember that you’re on your own timeline, not anyone else’s. If you compare yourself to the people around you, you’ll inevitably feel inadequate, but if you trust that you’re moving at the right pace for you, it’ll be much easier to get where you want to go.

Cancer Daily Horoscope

You’re brave and determined, but at a certain point, you get tired of meeting challenge after challenge with courage and integrity. Today, you might feel particularly drained; you just want to hide from it all. Right now though, the best way to care for yourself isn’t to retreat from the world around you, but to engage with it. You don’t need to go on big adventures if you’re not up for it, but seeing new sights and interacting with people will fill your cup more than sitting at home.

Leo Daily Horoscope

You tend to express your opinions forcefully, and you stand by them, often doubling down when others challenge you. But even if you’re right almost all of the time, there will still be instances when you misjudge people, jump to the wrong conclusion, and say things you regret. Your pride makes it hard to admit when you’ve made a mistake, but today, it might get a bit easier to show yourself grace. You’re not responsible for knowing all the answers, only for being willing to learn and grow.

Virgo Daily Horoscope

You often underestimate the effect you have on the people around you. It might seem like they aren’t paying attention to you, like they’re only half-listening when you share your ideas — but in fact, you hold more sway than you realize. Your friends look up to you, they want you to think well of them, and they take your feedback seriously — even if they don’t always show it. Don’t hesitate to speak up today; the people in your life are listening more closely than you realize.

Libra Daily Horoscope

The harder you work, the more you care about getting results. It’s hard to see the point of putting real effort into a project if you’re not going to get anywhere, or investing time into a relationship that might not work out. It’s reasonable to feel this way; the problem is that you can’t always control outcomes — especially when other people are in the mix. Today, focus on the process. If you take each step with intention, you’ll be able to hold your head up high whatever happens in the end.

Scorpio Daily Horoscope

It’s all too easy to become convinced that your actions don’t matter — the world is vast and you’re only one person; you struggle to see how anything you do could make a difference. But thinking this way helps nobody, so today, push back against it. You don’t need to make grand, impressive gestures — simply connecting with other people, and putting your energy to good use instead of letting it wither away inside you, is enough. It’s not about convincing anyone else that you’re powerful, but about reminding yourself.

Sagittarius Daily Horoscope

In general, you’re a big-picture kind of thinker; you’re good at seeing the patterns that your more detail-oriented friends tend to miss, and you’re good at coming up with grand, unifying theories about the world. Today though, remember there are exceptions to every rule. People won’t always behave the way you expect them to, and your own thoughts and feelings often break the mold, too. Give everyone, including yourself, the space to be who they actually are, not who you think they’re supposed to be.

Capricorn Daily Horoscope

You probably aren’t the sort of person who enjoys arguing for its own sake, but you’re not one to shy away from it, either. If someone is unfairly criticizing you, you’ll fight back; if they’re making claims that you know are untrue, you’ll set the record straight. You care about being right, and you want everyone else to recognize that you know what you’re talking about. Sometimes, though, it gets exhausting to feel like you always have to prove yourself. Today, try to put more energy into connecting with other people than in deciding who’s “right.”

Aquarius Daily Horoscope

Your own comfort isn’t generally a top priority for you — maybe because you’re too busy ruminating on bigger ideas to worry about something so trivial, or maybe because you imagine that you don’t really deserve to feel at ease. But today, make an effort to be kind to yourself. Give a bit of extra attention to your emotional and physical needs. Neglecting yourself won’t make you wiser or a “better person” — it’ll only make everything else more difficult.

Pisces Daily Horoscope

When you aren’t sure what kind of life you want to live, or how you should be spending your time, it’s only natural to look to the people around you for guidance. Navigating the world can be confusing, and it can be helpful to see how others do it. Today, just make sure you’re not putting too much stock in the actions of other people: they’re on their own paths, and your job isn’t to follow them, but to find yours. You’re wiser than you sometimes give yourself credit for, so trust your instincts.

'SNL' Alum Victoria Jackson Slams Tom Hanks MAGA Skit as 'Stupid' - TMZ,"Tom Hanks has found himself in hot water after poking fun at Trump supporters on ""SNL"" this past weekend – and now, one of the show's own alums is jumping in to slam him.",https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/18/snl-alum-victoria-jackson-slams-tom-hanks-maga-skit/,music,"Tom Hanks has found himself in hot water after poking fun at Trump supporters on 'SNL' this past weekend – and now, one of the show's own alums is jumping in to slam him.

Victoria Jackson, a staunch Trump supporter, is making her anger known to TMZ, pointing us to a post by political commentator Link Lauren, who calls out the ""MAGA = racist"" trope as ""downright disgusting"" -- a sentiment VJ says summarizes her feelings.

Victoria -- who was a cast member from '86 to '92 -- calls the whole thing ""stupid,"" adding she was also offended by the sexual vulgarity on the show.

Tom Hanks just came out on SNL in a MAGA hat for a bit where he acted like he didn’t want to shake a black man’s hand.



This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting. SNL is an unfunny show… pic.twitter.com/PlSc7gmiJ0 — Link Lauren (@itslinklauren) February 17, 2025 @itslinklauren

Victoria, who was on the red carpet at last night's show, notes another ex-cast member next to her laughed at the ""crude jokes,"" sarcastically adding the show seemed to have something for everyone -- but then quips, ""Did anyone make fun of the Kamala supporters?!""

In Link’s X post -- which Victoria says perfectly captured her feelings -- he slammed Hanks’ skit where he played a Trump supporter who acted like he was scared to shake a Black man’s hand -- calling it the reason why the show’s ratings ""are in the gutter."""
'The Brutalist' Director Brady Corbet Says He Made No Money From the Film - Hollywood Reporter,"“I've spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can't pay their rent,"" Corbet said. ""I mean, that's a real thing.""",http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-brutalist-brady-corbet-made-no-money-1236139785/,music,"The Brutalist director Brady Corbet said this week he “made zero dollars” on his Oscar-nominated film.

“I just directed three advertisements in Portugal,” Corbet said during an appearance on WTF With Marc Maron. “It’s the first time that I had made any money in years.”

Corbet went on to elaborate that he and his wife (and creative partner) Mona Fastvold, “made zero dollars on the last two films that we made.”

Before The Brutalist, Corbet and Fastvold made 2018’s Vox Lux. The Brutalist earned 10 nominations for this year’s Academy Awards, including best actor for Adrien Brody, best supporting actress for Felicity Jones, best director for Corbet and best picture.

When Maron asked Corbet to clarify his comments about payment, the director said, “Yes. Actually, zero. We had to just sort of live off of a paycheck from three years ago.”

The financial toll is not exclusive to Corbet, he said. “I’ve spoken to many filmmakers that have the films that are nominated this year that can’t pay their rent. I mean, that’s a real thing.”

The director went on to note that filmmakers are “not paid to be promoting a film,” and that “if you look at certain films that premiered in Cannes, that was almost a year ago … I mean, our film premiered in September. So I’ve been doing this for six months. And had zero income because I don’t have any time to go to work. I can’t even take a writing job at the moment.”

Corbet said the lengthy press circuit feels like “a six-month interrogation,” later saying he completed 90 interviews last week.

“It’s seven days a week,” he said. “It’s boundless. It’s constant travel, and you’re also working Saturdays and Sundays. I haven’t had a day off since the Christmas break, and that was also only four days.”"

"Bethenny Frankel praises Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds 'SNL 50' appearance - New York Post ",A “bravo” from Bethenny.,https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/entertainment/bethenny-frankel-praises-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-snl-50-appearance/,music,"A “bravo” from Bethenny.

Bethenny Frankel has praised Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for showing up to the “SNL” 50th anniversary special on Sunday amid their ongoing legal fight with Lively’s “It Ends With Us” co-star and director, Justin Baldoni.

In the first of two videos posted to her Instagram on Monday, the former “Real Housewives of New York” star, 54, also lauded “SNL” for including the stars in the special, adding that the couple’s decision to poke fun at their battle with Baldoni was “nothing short of genius.”

“Absolutely brilliant of ‘SNL’ to invite and include Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively to lean into the humor,” Frankel began. “They are the epicenter of pop culture. It is the zeitgeist. Bullseye.”

She continued, “And for Ryan and Blake to participate is nothing short of genius, because the only way to weather a storm is to go straight through it.”

“And as I keep saying, no one knows what actually happened,” the Skinny Girl founder added, referring to Lively and Baldoni’s contradictory claims about the drama that unfolded behind the scenes during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

“So all of this speculation is a tricky and risky business. But that was very smart. Bravo,” Frankel concluded.

Reynolds nodded to his and Lively’s drama with Baldoni an hour into “SNL 50” during a segment where Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took questions from the star-studded audience in Rockefeller Center’s Studio 8H.

“Ryan Reynolds, how’s it going?” Poehler, 53, asked.

Reynolds then quipped, “Why? What have you heard?”

After facing criticism for her remarks in the comments, Frankel posted another clip, in which she declared she “is tripling down.”

“So many comments on ‘SNL’ and I am tripling down and saying that ‘SNL’ was nothing short of brilliant for having them on last night,” she told viewers. “It’s marketing genius.”

“They are the epicenter. They are the zeitgeist that is popular culture. They often have disruptive people on,” Frankel said of the sketch comedy show.”They talk about disruptive topics They will have both political candidates on. They will have people mocking both political candidates. So from their standpoint, it was nothing short of brilliant.”

Turning to Lively and Reynolds, the reality TV star said, “Whether you like them or not, [it] was smart of Blake and Ryan to go [to ‘SNL 50’].”

Frankel did, however, point out that she was speaking only from a marketing perspective, alluding to the allegations of sexual harassment Lively has leveled against Baldoni and the domestic violence at the center of the story in “It Ends With Us.”

“Now there’s a conversation about it being tone-deaf because of the topic. A very sensitive topic, which was also a complaint at the premiere that she was marketing hair and drinking at a movie premiere about S.A. [sexual assault],” she said, alluding to complaints about Lively marketing a new haircare line when “It Ends With Us” was released and including specialty cocktails from her alcoholics drink company at the premiere.

“So that’s a separate conversation,” Frankel stressed. “But from a marketing standpoint, it was a great idea on everyone’s part.

Referring to social media sleuths, she added, “Not everyone lives in the bowels of Tik-Tok reading every single legal document and knows every single thing that you guys all know.”

“Even Candace Owens would likely agree that ‘SNL’ was brilliant from a marketing standpoint,” Frankel said of the conservative commentator, who has been a vocal critic of Reynolds and Lively.

“She may not like it, and many of you don’t like the ‘ick’ of all of it, but that’s a touching story. From a marketing standpoint, it was smart.”

In December 2024, Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, accusing him of sexual harassment and orchestrating a public smear campaign against her.

Baldoni countersued her and Reynolds, 48, alleging defamation, extortion and more. Both stars have denied the other’s claims through their respective lawyers.

The legal war between Lively and Baldoni shows no sign of cooling down, with mediation seeming unlikely. On Friday, attorneys for both stars told Judge Lewis Liman that “settlement discussions would be premature,” according to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by Fox News Digital.

Lively and Baldoni’s trial is set for March 2026."

‘Last Week Tonight’ YouTube Release Delay Eliminated After John Oliver Called It “Massively Frustrating” - Deadline,'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. The episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.,http://deadline.com/2025/02/last-week-tonight-john-oliver-youtube-release-schedule-1236293211/,music,"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver kicked off its new season Sunday on HBO and Max. To fans’ surprise and delight, the episode also was made available on YouTube the same night.

This is a reversal of the release pattern HBO implemented last season, pushing the release of each new Sunday night episode’s main story on YouTube from the following Monday to the following Thursday in an effort to drive up subscribers to the Max streaming service. The move triggered backlash among fans and was called “massively frustrating” by Oliver.

HBO made an exception for Last Week Tonight‘s pre-election episode last November. That episode’s main segment, in which Oliver spoke of “the damage of a second Trump term,” urging everyone to vote for Kamala Harris, was released on YouTube shortly after the show had aired on the linear HBO network on the West Coast.

Watch on Deadline

At the time, HBO insiders stressed that the quick YouTube release was a one-off. It is now once again becoming the norm. The reversal decision, which Oliver had been advocating for, was made after data analysis didn’t reveal a significant increase in Max viewership after implementing the delay, sources said.

As it’s always been the case, only Last Week Tonight episodes’ main story will be released on YouTube. Last night’s episode was an exception as Oliver devoted the entire show to Donald Trump’s first month in office and the actions of Elon Musk, whom he called “a parasitic freak,” and his DOGE team.

As a result, the full episode was released on YouTube Sunday night."
Shakira’s tour back on track after Peru concert cancelled due to hospital admission - CNN,"Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/entertainment/shakira-hospital-peru-concert-cancelled-scli-intl/index.html,music,"CNN —

Colombian pop superstar Shakira will perform in Lima, Peru, this Monday, after cancelling a show Sunday night due to an abdominal issue which required hospital admission.

Master Live, the company organizing Shakira’s concert in Lima, confirmed on Monday that the event scheduled for Monday, February 17 at the National Stadium in Peru’s capital at 8:15 p.m. local time will take place.

“We are pleased to inform that today’s concert will take place as normal. We want to thank Shakira for all the effort to make this show go ahead,” the statement from Master Live said.

Master Live added in its statement that they will announce the new date for the concert on Sunday that was canceled.

Posting to Instagram on Sunday, the singer previously said she had been taken to the emergency room and was advised to cancel the concert.

“The doctors whose care I am currently under have communicated that I am not in good enough condition to perform this evening,” she said.

“I am very sad to not be able to take (to) the stage today. I’ve been looking forward to reuniting with my incredible fans here in Peru,” Shakira said, adding that she hoped to be discharged soon.

“My team and the promoters are already working on a new date to communicate to you,” she added. So far there is no statement confirming that the singer has already left the hospital.

CNN is trying to contact Shakira’s team for more information. Meanwhile, Shakira’s social media has posted announcements of Monday’s concert and the list of songs that the Colombian singer is expected to sing tonight in Lima.

In a previous post, Shakira had thanked her Peruvian fans for a warm welcome to the country alongside a series of photos showing the singer greeting crowds of well wishers.

The singer recently embarked on a world tour and is set to play shows in various Latin American countries before embarking on a US leg of the tour starting May 13 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The tour is named “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,” or “Women Don’t Cry Anymore.”

Shakira is considered one of the most popular Latin American recording artists of the early 21st century.

However, she’s faced some controversy in recent years.

In November 2023, Shakira settled her tax evasion suit with the Spanish authorities.

The Grammy-winning singer admitted the charges against her and agreed to pay the amount owed in full and an additional fine, according to a statement released by the Barcelona prosecutor’s office at the time.

She paid a total of €17.5 million ($19 million), an amount composed of the taxes she owed plus interest, as well as a fine of €7.3 million ($8 million), the statement said."

Matt Damon Is Odysseus in First Image from Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Odyssey’ - IndieWire,Matt Damon plays the Greek soldier Odysseus in the first look at Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey.',https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/christopher-nolan-the-odyssey-first-look-matt-damon-1235096411/,music,"On President’s Day, cinephiles got their first look at what just might be the most anticipated movie of 2026: Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey.” Universal took to its official social media accounts to release the first photo from the film, which shows Matt Damon in costume as Odysseus, the mythical Greek hero who spends a decade trying to return home after fighting in the Trojan War.

Damon was one of the first cast members announced for Nolan’s film, and was soon joined by Tom Holland, Zendaya, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong’o, Benny Safdie, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, and Elliot Page. None of the casting announcements have been accompanied by news about who is playing which character from Homer’s epic poem — though that did not stop fans from speculating that Holland could be playing Odysseus’ son Telemachus — so Universal’s post marks the first official confirmation that Damon is playing the titular role.

Announced in December 2024, Nolan’s take on “The Odyssey” will be his 13th feature film. The box office success and Oscar dominance of “Oppenheimer” ensured that Nolan’s follow-up would be among the most coveted projects in Hollywood for actors and studios alike. Despite rumors of outreach from his former home Warner Bros., where he had worked for decades prior to “Oppenheimer,” Nolan opted to return to Universal for “The Odyssey.”

“Christopher Nolan’s next film ‘The Odyssey’ is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” the studio wrote in a post on X announcing the film in December. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.”

Nolan is unsurprisingly expected to shoot the film in IMAX formats, with production taking place in 2026 in Sicily, England, and Morocco. Many of the Sicilian islands are believed to be the locations Homer was referencing in his original text, as global borders have been significantly redrawn in the last three thousand years. It appears that Nolan is devoting the extensive Hollywood resources at his disposal to capturing the foundational text with an eye for both its epic scale and period detail.

A Universal release, “The Odyssey” opens in theaters on July 17, 2026."
Netflix Doc Reveals That Gabby Petito Called an Ex-Boyfriend for Comfort Hours Before Her Death - Variety,Netflix's 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' unpacks her disappearance and shows Gabby Petito called an ex-boyfriend for comfort hours before her death.,https://variety.com/2025/streaming/features/gabby-petito-american-murder-netflix-called-ex-boyfriend-before-death-1236310695/,music,"It’s been three and a half years since Gabby Petito made headlines around the world after she vanished during a cross-country road trip she was taking with her fiance Brian Laundrie. Now, a new three-part docuseries, “American Murder: Gabby Petito,” goes beyond the headlines to reveal the reality of a 22-year-old woman enmeshed in an abusive relationship.

After Petito disappeared in August 2021, Laundrie returned to his parents’ house in North Port, Fla., where he refused to discuss Petito’s whereabouts. Laundrie’s refusal to speak to the police caused a media firestorm, which escalated when Petito’s body was found in Wyoming’s Bridger-Teton National Forest on Sept. 19, 2021. An autopsy concluded that Petito died by homicide. Laundrie, who was eventually revealed to be the killer, died by suicide in October 2021.

The series, directed by Julia Willoughby Nason and Michael Gasparro, features Peitito’s family and several of her close friends. Never-before-seen text messages, police body cam footage, and excerpts from Petito’s personal journal are also used to tell Petito’s story. Notably, the doc uses outtakes from Petito’s #Vanlife Vlog, which reveal that her happy, “Insta-perfect” face for social media was, especially in the last few weeks of her life, a facade.

Popular on Variety

The docuseries marks the third installment of Netflix’s “American Murder” franchise. “American Murder: The Family Next Door” streamed in 2020 and was followed by 2024’s “American Murder: Laci Peterson.”

Variety spoke to Willoughby Nason and Gasparro about accessing police body cam footage, Brian Laundrie’s parents, and what surprised them about the Petito case.

In the series, Gabby’s biological parents, as well as both of her stepparents, are very candid about their daughter and her murder, which seemed painful to recount. How did you convince the family to participate? Were they paid?

Gasparro: No. This was all about The Gabby Petito Foundation. Netflix doesn’t do a lot of action items, or cards (listing foundations) or anything like that because it’s a documentary. But we were able to get a clip into episode three where the family was able to talk about the foundation. So, the whole goal here is to push people towards The Gabby Petito Foundation, which helps bring awareness to domestic violence.

Did you find it difficult to ask to do those interviews since you were asking people to recount the worst weeks of their lives?

Willoughby Nason: We do very long interviews. So, we had time with the family to unpack things, to take breaks, and to slow down. Having done these kinds of interviews over the years with families who have lost loved ones, I see how hard it is for them to relive and tell these stories, but I think it’s also very healing and cathartic to be able to speak about what they are feeling on a daily basis because it doesn’t go away unfortunately for them.

Did the family provide you with all the unseen footage from Gabby’s #Vanlife Vlog?

Gasparro: Yes. When we met with her parents, they gave us all this stuff to go through, which included all of Gabby’s journals, all of her artwork, and then all the footage. Her curated #Vanlife footage proves what a great editor she was. She knew what she was doing, and she was very determined. But the (outtakes) allow you to unpack her journey, and that, to us, was amazing. It was really just a way to help tell the story through her.

In the series, it’s revealed that Gabby called an ex-boyfriend in the days leading up to her disappearance and on the day detectives think she was murdered. Did that surprise you?

Gasparro: Yes. We didn’t know about that. We didn’t know she had reached out to him during a vulnerable time (during her trip with Brian). She was obviously suffering. She trusted her ex and reached out. It was like a cry for help. We think that’s probably something that Brian caught wind of.

When Petito went missing, a snippet of the police bodycam footage captured on Aug. 12, 2021 in Moab, Utah of Gabby and Brian circulated in newsfeeds around the country. In your series, you reveal the entirety of the bodycam footage for the first time. How did you get all of that unseen footage?

Gasparro: Through FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests.

The footage is pretty infuriating. Did you ask the Moab police who were involved with the incident for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes, but they declined.

I’m assuming you also asked Brian’s parents – Christopher and Roberta Laundrie – for an interview?

Gasparro: Yes. They also declined. We had to respect that. You can only do so much, and we are not a news organization. We are not going to stand on their lawn and beg them to be on the series. For us, it was about telling Gabby’s story first and foremost. People tend to love to tell the story about the murderer, but we felt Gabby’s story was more important.

After this process, do you think Brian’s family knew that he murdered Gabby long before his confession letter was found?

Willoughby Nason: Based on the phone records that we highlight in the series, we know that Brian called his parents for almost an hour from Wyoming around the time Gabby went missing. I think to us, that really tips the hat that something was communicated there early on between his family. We don’t know what, but we do know that he told his dad, ‘Gabby’s gone, and I need a lawyer.’ We see in the phone records that the parents contacted a lawyer in Wyoming right after Brian’s call to them. So, it’s suspicious.

Were there any interesting things that you learned while making the film that you couldn’t fit into the series?

Willoughby Nason: I learned that Gabby was a prolific artist and that she was very industrious in terms of wanting to be an influencer and how to build this van. All of this was her idea.

Gasparro: There was an entire cross-country trip that they took prior to moving to Florida that we didn’t know about, but we had to move things along for the viewer.

Dr. Phil served as an executive producer on this series. How did that happen?

Gasparro: Sarah Carden (“Dr. Phil” senior supervising news producer) reached out to us and said that she loved “Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal,” which we made for Netflix in 2023. She told us that the (Petito) family, who had a relationship with Dr. Phil, wanted to tell their story because they hadn’t actually sat down or partnered with anybody to tell Gabby’s story. They had done sit-down interviews while everything was unpacking, but Sarah said that they wanted filmmakers like us to tell Gabby’s story.

‘Captain America: Brave New World’ Opened to $100 Million. Does a ‘B-’ CinemaScore Spell Trouble For Staying Power? - Variety,"""Captain America: Brave New World"" opened to a mighty $100 million. But how will the superhero sequel hold in subsequent weeks at the box office?",https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/captain-america-brave-new-world-box-office-staying-power-marvel-cinematic-universe-1236310075/,music,"“Captain America: Brave New World” proves that Marvel hasn’t lost its mojo. The fourth “Captain America” installment, and the first in which Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield, delivered a mighty $100 million in its domestic debut over the extended Presidents Day weekend. The film added another $92.4 million overseas for a $192.4 million global tally, easily the best start of the (nascent) year.

Yet opening weekends are rarely a problem for Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. To wit: All 35 films in the sprawling comic book franchise have launched to No. 1, even the ones described by critics as a “pile of dirt.” So in the case of “Captain America: Brave New World,” all eyes will be on the staying power — industry parlance for how a movie’s ticket sales hold (or don’t) in the subsequent weekends on the big screen.

Popular on Variety

That’s of paramount concern because the all-powerful MCU has struggled with commercial consistency since the epic success of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” and these superhero sequels don’t come cheap. “Captain America: Brave New World” cost north of $180 million to make and at least $100 million to market across the globe. And it’s just one of three Marvel movies this year with “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” to follow in the summer.

“When you look at the release calendar, I don’t see anything that can cut into ‘Captain America,'” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “If audiences want to be entertained at a blockbuster level, it’s their only option.”

Indeed, there’s nothing resembling a four-quadrant blockbuster on the calendar until Disney’s “Snow White” remake on March 21. So cinema operators need “Captain America: Brave New World” to endure on the scale of 2023’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” rather than “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Marvels” to be deemed a financial winner.

“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” powered to $118 million domestically at the start of that summer’s movie season and continued to draw audiences in the following weekends, with revenues declining by 47% in its second and third outing and 35% in its fourth frame. Those were decent holds compared to other superhero films of its size. The third “Guardians” ended its run with $358 million in North America and a sizable $845 million globally. That’s the best case scenario for Cap’s latest cinematic adventure.

Yet the reality is that even Marvel’s biggest blockbusters have plunged after record-breaking debuts in the post-“Endgame” era. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and “Thor: Love and Thunder,” which earned $955 million and $760 million respectively in 2022, each declined 67% in their sophomore outings.

Then there’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania,” which scored a trilogy-best $120 million debut over Presidents Day weekend in 2023. Saddled with some of the worst reviews of any MCU film, ticket sales collapsed by 70% in its second weekend. The film ultimately failed to cross the $500 million mark worldwide, a modest benchmark for Marvel. Not to be outdone, “The Marvels,” the sole MCU movie to flop out of the gate, took a 78% nosedive in its second weekend.

“This has a chance to have long playability. ‘Ant-Man’ didn’t have that,” says Bock, referring to sleeper hits like “Cocaine Bear” and “Jesus Revolution,” both of which opened the weekend after “Quantumania.”

For “Captain America: Brave New World,” reviews and audience reactions aren’t exactly encouraging for the film’s theatrical endurance. The movie has dismal marks, at least by MCU standards, with a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and lousy “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls.

However there are signs, beyond a lack of competition, that Cap and company could withstand the bad buzz and give the box office a needed boost. The film boasted a strong turnout across all demographics; 35% of opening weekend ticket buyers were Caucasian, 26% were Latino and Hispanic, 23% were Black and 10% were Asian. It’s a sign the tentpole has the kind of broad appeal that’s necessary to boost a given movie from mere hit to runaway (Hulk) smash.

Moreover, sources close to the superhero adaptation believe that CinemaScore isn’t the best measure of moviegoer reception. They feel that way because those grades are bestowed after polling patrons in just a few theaters. On Rotten Tomatoes, a more expansive metric, “Captain America: Brave New World” has a stronger 80% “verified audience score.” (“Quantumania” has an 81% “verified audience score.”) PostTrak, another metric to poll moviegoers, reported that parents and kids gave the film four out of five stars. However, general audiences handed out three of five stars.

“Captain America: Brave New World” was also popular in premium formats with Imax, Dolby and other like formats accounting for 44% of inaugural sales. Those tickets are more expensive than standard 2D screens and have helped to offset a downward trend in attendance.

“We’re very happy on our side,” says Chris Randleman of Texas-based luxury movie theater chain Flix Brewhouse. “Walk-up business has been great despite the reviews. It’s an accessible film with a clear hook.”

He adds, “It’s going to look like ticket sales had a big drop. But that’s because this weekend is inflated with the double holiday of Valentine’s Day and Presidents Day.”

VIP+ Analysis: ‘Captain America’ Sequel Anything but Brave New Era for Aging Marvel IP

After the embarrassing misfires of “Ant-Man” and “The Marvels,” Disney’s CEO Bob Iger announced a company-wide mandate to focus on quality over quantity. “At the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making,” Iger said during a 2023 earnings call. “We lost some focus.”

That year, in addition to the three theatrical releases, there were three Disney+ television series. Then, 2024 marked an aberration with just one film (along with another three seasons of television) on the calendar. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” an R-rated buddy comedy led by two of the most popular comic book characters, became an unmitigated smash with $1.33 billion globally.

Marvel is back to regularly scheduled programming with another two tentpoles on schedule over the next six months: “Thunderbolts” on May 2 and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” on July 25. Amid those megawatt titles, DC Comics has “Superman,” a Man of Steel reboot from director James Gunn, on July 11. Hollywood is banking on this year’s quartet of comic book offerings to revive the hit-or-miss superhero genre.

“The industry needs Marvel. No other film is opening to over $100 million in February,” says Bock. “Having three of them on the calendar is a bright spot.”"
'SNL50' didn't do justice to the past 50 years of comedy: Review - USA TODAY,"""Saturday Night Live"" cast past and present tried their best to make a 50th anniversary special, but failed to make it as good as regular ""SNL.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/02/17/snl-50-anniversary-special-review/78908273007/,music,"Fifty years of ""Saturday Night Live"" is a lot of history, legacy and pressure to pack into a one-night special, even if it's 3½ hours long.

But producer Lorne Michaels and the ""SNL"" cast and writers, past and present, tried to do just that in the show's 50th anniversary special Sunday on NBC, a star-studded black-tie bacchanalia of celebrity cameos, sketch revivals and self-congratulatory montages that gave it the flavor of an awards show crossed with an extended episode of ""SNL"" crossed with a drunken party that should have been attended only by people who have actually worked on the show. The special even featured an ""In Memoriam"" segment, although it was reserved for all the offensive and poorly aged sketches over the years (and to remind us they re-aired a lot of the racist and sexist stuff).

It was a tonnage of effort and personality smushed onto the Studio 8H stage, and it all added up to something that was, well, fine? You could call it serviceable, checking nostalgia boxes while trying desperately to remain relevant to the youth of today, with more screen time for Sabrina Carpenter than Bill Murray. It had almost all the still-living heavy hitters from the series' history doing chuckle-worthy monologues and sketches. It was humorous, if not hilarious. And if we hadn't seen a similar but far better version of this a decade ago when the show celebrated its 40th anniversary, it might have been more satisfactory.

Maybe producers didn't want to repeat the classic sketches used in 2015, leaving the 50th stuck with the also-rans and ones that are less than a year old. The only advantage ""SNL50"" had over ""SNL40"" is that this time, Eddie Murphy actually appeared in sketches. But overall, it was a wasted opportunity to do something slightly different and far more transcendent.

The night started sleepily, and it was difficult to build energy. Opening with Carpenter, the hot pop star of the moment, and Paul Simon, an ""SNL"" staple since the show's second episode and a close friend of Michaels', was clearly an effort to marry the past and present, young and old. But the choice of ballad ""Homeward Bound"" made the cold open somber and slow. A monologue from consummate host Steve Martin brought a little bit of verve (especially his ""Gulf of America"" joke), but the momentum careened to a halt with a reprisal of Kristen Wiig's tiny-handed Dooneese sketch that went on far too long and for some reason included Kim Kardashian.

The rest of the evening veered from adequate to mediocre, with a flash or two of genuine brilliance. Murphy put his whole heart and soul into a Tracy Morgan impression for the ""Black Jeopardy!"" sketch that was, honest to goodness, the best thing the 63-year-old comedian and movie star has done in a decade. Mike Myers' classic ""Coffee Talk"" character Linda Richman joined Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler for ""Bronx Beat,"" a crossover that was smooth as buttah. But that was all alongside another edition of this season's already overplayed ""Domingo"" sketch, Murphy in a cringeworthy ""Scared Straight"" bit, and Kate McKinnon's usually hilarious alien abductee, who was upstaged by a fuzzy Meryl Streep cameo.

Nearly every sketch could have used the ruthless red pen of an editor as it dragged on to fill time. Most also felt as if they were only 80% finished. A New York history-themed installment of John Mulaney's trademark musical parodies featured some good moments, but it also felt as if it had no point. Plus we got another one of these back in November, the last time Mulaney hosted. Did we really need another one so soon?'

It's such a shame, because ""SNL40"" felt so essential to any fan of the series because the sketches were both familiar and novel: a ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"" that honored Will Ferrell and Norm Macdonald but left room for current cast member McKinnon to shine. A digital short from Andy Samberg and Adam Sandler making fun of cast members who ""break"" and giggle during a sketch. They were sketches that felt as if they could happen only on an anniversary show, and not just because of all the cameos; it's because they truly honored the show's legacy past and present. ""SNL50"" merely managed a handful of unsuccessful attempts to mesh what the show was with what it is now. But by the time Paul McCartney closed out the show, it felt as if we had all taken a dose of the ""After Update"" sleeping pill Alec Baldwin joked about in his short appearance.

A half-century in, ""SNL"" is something too big to be contained, let alone distilled into something succinct and sensational. Any version of a 50th anniversary special would likely disappoint in some way; there's just too much history here to get in everything everyone wants to see. But the version of the special Michaels and the writers created didn't have the sparkle of the show at its height.

It's nostalgic to watch the re-creations of the ""SNL"" of the past, but maybe we're better off just rewatching the sketches that made the show a cultural landmark in the first place."
